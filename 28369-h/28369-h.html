<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hebrew literature contains some of the most profound
and most influential productions of the human spirit.
It constitutes a potent factor in modern civilization,
and possesses merits which place it far above most other literatures
of the world. The common salutation of the Hebrew is
<span class="tei tei-q">“Peace,”</span> while that of the Greeks is <span class="tei tei-q">“Grace,”</span> and that of the
Romans, <span class="tei tei-q">“Safety.”</span> The Greek sought after grace, or intellectual
and bodily perfection, and the power of artistic accomplishment.
The Roman's ideal was strength and security of life and
property. The Hebrew sought after peace, peace in the heart, as
founded on a sense of Jehovah's good providence, and a moral
conformity in conduct to His revealed will. While the Greek
in art, literature, and even in morals, made beauty his standard,
the Roman stood for power, domination and law, and the Hebrew
for religion. The Hebrew, indeed, introduced into Europe
the first clear conception of religion, as implied in monotheism,
and a rigidly defined moral law, founded upon the will of
Jehovah. The basis of morals among the Latins was political,
among the Greeks æsthetic, and among the Hebrews it was the
revealed will of Jehovah.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While the most important remains of Hebrew literature are
comprised in the Scriptures known to us as the Bible, there exists
also a voluminous mass of Hebrew writings which are not
included in the sacred canon. These writings are of supreme
importance and value, and the selections which we have made
from them in the present volume give a good idea of their interest,
beauty, and subtlety of thought.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the very beginning of their history the Hebrews were
a deeply poetic race. They were fully alive to the beauties of external
nature, and no national poetry contains more vivid
descriptions of the sea, sky, and the panorama of forest, stream
and mountain, peopled by the varied activities of animated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageiv">[pg iv]</span><a name="Pgiv" id="Pgiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nature. The songs of Zion glow with poetic enthusiasm, but
their principal characteristic is their intense earnestness. They
are no idle lays of love and wine or warlike triumph. They
depict the joy of existence as dependent upon the smile and
favor of Jehovah, and all the happiness, plenty, victory and
success of life are attributed, without hesitation, to nothing else
but <span class="tei tei-q">“the loving-kindness of the Lord.”</span> Yet this religious
fervor becomes the basis of sublimity, pathos, and picturesqueness,
such as can seldom be approached even by the finest productions
of the Attic muse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the Hebrews were also philosophers, and if they never
attained to what we may call the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">netteté et clarté</span></span>
of the Greek metaphysician, they excelled all other thinkers in the boldness
and profound spirituality of their philosophical mysticism. In
proof of this assertion we may point to that body of writings
known as the Kabbalah.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The word <span class="tei tei-q">“Kabbalah”</span> means <span class="tei tei-q">“doctrine received by oral
tradition,”</span> and is applied to these remains to distinguish them
from the canonical Hebrew Scriptures, which were written
by <span class="tei tei-q">“the Finger of Jehovah.”</span> Hebrew speculation attempts in
the Kabbalah to give a philosophical or theosophistic basis to
Hebrew belief, while at the same time it supplements the doctrines
of the Old Testament. For instance, it is a disputed point
whether the immortality of the soul is taught in the Hebrew
canon, but in the Kabbalah it is taken for granted, and a complete
and consistent psychology is propounded, in which is
included the Oriental theory of metempsychosis. This account
of the human soul, as distinct from the human body, treats of
the origin and eternal destiny of man's immortal part. On the
other hand God and Nature, and the connection between the
Creator and the creation, are most exactly treated of in detail.
God is the <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">En-Soph</span></span>, the boundless One, as in
modern philosophy God is the Absolute. He manifests Himself in the ten
<span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">Sephiroth</span></span>,
or intelligences. It would be easy on this point to show Dante's
indebtedness to the Kabbalah in his description of the various
heavens of his Paradise. These intelligences control, in groups
of three, the three worlds of intellect, of soul, and of matter.
The tenth of the <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">Sephiroth</span></span> is called Kingdom,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the personal
Deity, as seen in the workings of Providence, with which conception
we may compare Dante's description of Fortune, in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagev">[pg v]</span><a name="Pgv" id="Pgv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
seventh book of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Inferno.”</span> This last of the
<span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">Sephiroth</span></span> is
manifested visibly in the Shekinah. This is the barest and
baldest outline of the main features in this famous system.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The rise of Kabbalism is not very clearly known as regards
authorship and date; it is in turn, by different Jewish writers,
ascribed to Adam, Abraham, Moses and Ezra; but doubtless the
work is an aggregation of successive writings, and some critics
believe that it was not compiled before the Middle Ages, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in
the centuries between the conquest of Gaul by the Franks and
the period following the death of Dante.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There can be no doubt that the Kabbalah contains the ripest
fruit of spiritual and mystical speculation which the Jewish
world produced on subjects which had hitherto been obscured by
the gross anthropomorphism of such men as Maimonides and
his school. We can understand the revolt of the devout Hebrew
mind from traditions like those which represented Jehovah as
wearing a phylactery, and as descending to earth for the purpose
of taking a razor and shaving the head and beard of Sennacherib.
The theory of the <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">Sephiroth</span></span> was at least a
noble and truly reverent guess at the mode of God's immanence in
nature. This conception won the favor of Christian philosophers
in the Middle Ages, and, indeed, was adopted or adapted
by the angelic Doctor Aquinas himself, the foremost of ecclesiastical
and scholastic metaphysicians. The psychology of the
Kabbalah, even its treatment of the soul's preëxistence before
union with the body, found many advocates among Gentile
and even Christian philosophers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are therefore led to the conclusion that the Kabbalah is
by far the most exalted, the most profound and the most interesting
of all that mass of traditional literature which comprises,
among other writings, such remains as the Targums and the
Talmud.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A study of Hebrew literature would indeed be incomplete
unless it included the Talmud.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Talmud”</span> in Hebrew means <span class="tei tei-q">“Doctrine,”</span> and this strange
work must be looked upon as a practical handbook, intended
for the Jews who, after the downfall of Jerusalem and the Dispersion,
found that most of the Law had to be adjusted to new
circumstances, in which the institution of sacrifices and propitiatory
offerings had been practically abolished. The Talmud
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
contains the decisions of Jewish doctors of many generations
on almost every single question which might puzzle the conscience
of a punctilious Jew in keeping the Law under the
altered conditions of the nation. The basis of the Talmud is the
Mishna, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, an explanation of the text of the Mosaic laws, and
their application to new cases and circumstances. The Mishna
has been well described by the illustrious Spanish Jew, Maimonides,
who in the twelfth century published it at Cordova,
with a preface, in which he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“From Moses, our teacher,
to our holy rabbi, no one has united in a single body of doctrine
what was publicly taught as the oral law; but in every generation,
the chief of the tribunal, or the prophet of his day, made
memoranda of what he had heard from his predecessors and
instructors, and communicated it orally to the people. In like
manner each individual committed to writing, for his own use
and according to the degree of his ability, the oral laws and
the information he had received respecting the interpretation
of the Bible, with the various decisions that had been pronounced
in every age and sanctified by the authority of the great
tribunal. Such was the form of proceeding until the coming
of our Rabbi the Holy, who first collected all the traditions, the
judgments, the sentences, and the expositions of the law,
heard by Moses, our master, and taught in each generation.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Mishna itself in turn became the subject of a series of
comments and elucidations, which formed what was called the
Gemara. The text of the original Hebrew scripture was abandoned,
and a new crop of casuistical quibbles, opinions and
decisions rose like mushrooms upon the text of the Mishna, and
from the combination of text and Gemaraic commentary was
formed that odd, rambling, and sometimes perplexing work,
<span class="tei tei-q">“wonderful monument of human industry, human wisdom
and human folly,”</span> which we know as the Talmud. The book
is compounded of all materials, an encyclopædia of history, antiquities
and chronology, a story book, a code of laws and conduct,
a manual of ethics, a treatise on astronomy, and a medical
handbook; sometimes indelicate, sometimes irreverent, but always
completely and persistently in earnest. Its trifling frivolity,
its curious prying into topics which were better left alone,
the occasional beauty of its spiritual and imaginative fancies,
make it one of the most remarkable books that human wit and
human industry have ever compiled.

The selections which we print in this volume are from the
Mishna, and form part of the Sedarim, or orders; in them are
given minute directions as to the ceremonial practice of the
Jewish religion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The treatise on <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessings”</span> speaks of daily prayers and
thanksgiving. It is most minute in prescribing the position of
the body, and how the voice is to be used in prayer. It
specifies the prayers to be said on seeing signs and wonders,
on building a house, on entering or leaving a city; and how to
speak the name of God in social salutations. That on the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Sabbatical Year”</span> is a discourse on agriculture from a religious
point of view. The Sabbatical year among the Hebrews
was every seventh year, in which the land was to be
left fallow and uncultivated, and all debts were to be remitted
or outlawed. Provision is made in this section for doing certain
necessary work, such as picking and using fruits which
may have grown without cultivation during the Sabbatical
year, with some notes on manuring the fields, pruning trees and
pulling down walls. Very interesting is the section which deals
with <span class="tei tei-q">“The Sabbath Day.”</span> The most minute and exhaustive
account is given of what may and what may not be done on the
seventh day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The treatise on <span class="tei tei-q">“The Day of Atonement”</span> deals with the
preparation and deportment of the high-priest on that day.
That on <span class="tei tei-q">“The Passover”</span> treats of the Lamb to be sacrificed,
of the search for leaven, so that none be found in the house, and
of all the details of the festival. <span class="tei tei-q">“Measurements”</span> is an interesting
and valuable account of the dimensions of the Temple
at Jerusalem. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Tabernacle”</span> deals with the ritual worship
of the Jews under the new conditions of their exile from
Palestine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All of these treatises show the vitality of Jewish religion
in Europe, under the most adverse circumstances, and
illustrate the place which the Talmud must have occupied in
Jewish history, as supplying a religious literature and a code of
ritual and worship which kept Judaism united, even when it had
become banished and dissociated from Palestine, Jerusalem, and
the Temple.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Talmud (teaching) comprises the Mishna and the
Gemara. The Mishna (<span class="tei tei-q">“learning”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“second law”</span>)
was, according to Jewish tradition, delivered to Moses
on Mount Sinai. <span class="tei tei-q">“Rabbi Levi, the son of Chama, says, Rabbi
Simon, the son of Lakish, says, what is that which is written,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘I will give thee tables of stone, and a law and commandments
which I have written, that thou mayest teach them’</span>?<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> The Tables are the ten commandments; the Law is the written
law; and the commandment is the Mishna; <span class="tei tei-q">‘which I have
written’</span> means the prophets and sacred writings; <span class="tei tei-q">‘that thou
mayest teach them’</span> means the Gemara. It teaches us that
they were all given to Moses from Mount Sinai.”</span> From
Moses the Mishna was transmitted by oral tradition through
forty <span class="tei tei-q">“Receivers,”</span> until the time of Rabbi Judah the Holy.
These Receivers were qualified by ordination to hand it on
from generation to generation. Abarbanel and Maimonides
disagree as to the names of these Receivers. While the Temple
still stood as a centre of unity to the nation, it was considered
unlawful to reduce these traditions to writing. But
when the Temple was burned, and the Jews were dispersed
among other peoples, it was considered politic to form them
into a written code, which should serve as a bond of union,
and keep alive the spirit of patriotism. The Jewish leaders
saw the effect of Constitutions and Pandects in consolidating
nations—the advantage of written laws over arbitrary decisions.
Numberless precedents of case law, answering to our
common law, were already recorded: and the teachings of the
Hebrew jurisconsults, or <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Responsa prudentium</span></span>”</span>
which were held to be binding on the people, had been preserved from
former ages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All these traditions Rabbi Judah the Holy undertook to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reduce into one digest. And this laborious work he completed
about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 190, or more than a century after the destruction
of Jerusalem by Titus. Rabbi Judah was born on the day
that Rabbi Akibah died. Solomon is said to have foretold
the event: <span class="tei tei-q">“One sun ariseth, and one sun goeth down.”</span>
Akibah was the setting and Judah the rising sun. The Mishna
of Rabbi Judah, afterward revised by Abba Areka in Sura, is
the text of the Babylon Talmud. The commentaries written
on this text by various Rabbis in the neighborhood of Babylon,
until the close of the fifth century, are called the Gemara
(completion), and are published in twelve folio volumes,
called the Babylon Talmud—the Talmud most esteemed by
the Jews. The Jerusalem Talmud contains commentaries
written partly by Rabbis in Jamnia and partly in Tiberias,
where they were completed by Rabbi Jochanan in the beginning
of the fourth century. As now published it has only
four out of the six orders or books of the Mishna, with the
treatise Niddah from the sixth. In the time of Maimonides it
contained five orders. On twenty-six treatises it has no Gemara,
though in the treatise on shekels the Gemara of Jerusalem
is used for the Babylon Talmud. The six books of the
Mishna are subdivided into sixty-three treatises, in the following
manner:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bed—grafting a scion on a stock of a different kind, suffering

of those which were to be carried to Jerusalem and there
eaten, or to be redeemed and the money spent in Jerusalem
in peace offerings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. <span class="tei tei-q">“Cake of Dough”</span> (Num. xv. 20) treats of setting apart
a cake of dough for the priests; also, from what kind of dough
the cake must be separated.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. <span class="tei tei-q">“Uncircumcised Fruit”</span> (Lev. xix. 23) treats of the unlawfulness
of eating the fruit of any tree till the fifth year.
The first three years it is uncircumcised; the fourth year it is
holy to the Lord; the fifth year it may be eaten.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
11. <span class="tei tei-q">“First Fruits”</span> (Exod. xxiii. 19; Deut. xxvi. 1) treats

boundaries, whereby all the inhabitants of the court, or entry,
where the mixture is made, are counted as one family inhabiting
one domicile; and are therefore allowed to carry
victuals from one house to another. It also treats of the
mixtures for a Sabbath day's journey, whereby the distance
may be extended for an additional 2,000 cubits.

of trial and punishment of criminals. Men may go home to
their wives from voluntary wars, but not from wars of command.
This tract shows the miserable state of the Jews at the
destruction of the second Temple, and at the future advent of

From the six books or <span class="tei tei-q">“Orders”</span> the Jews call the Babylon
Talmud by the pet name of <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Shas</span></span>”</span> (six). The
language in which it is written is Hebrew intermingled with Aramaic,
Chaldee, Syriac, Arabic, Greek, and Latin words. The
Gemara was first begun by Rabban Judah's two sons, Rabbi
Gamaliel and Rabbi Simeon. It was vigorously carried on
by Rabbi Ashé in Sura, a town on the Euphrates, from 365
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> to 425. He divided the Mishna into its sixty-three
treatises, and every half-year summoned his disciples and assigned
to them two fresh portions of the Law and two of the
Mishna. At each meeting their remarks on these portions
were discussed, and if approved were incorporated into the
Gemara. Rabbis Zabid, Gebhia Rychuma, and Semo of
Pumbedaitha;<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>
and Rabbis Marimer, Adda bar Abbin, Nachman
bar Huno, and Touspho, presidents of the schools of
Sura, labored for its advancement; and it was finally completed
by Rabbi Abino (Rabbina), and sealed by Rabbi José
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
about 498 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> He was the last of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Dictators.”</span> Those
who lived after him were called <span class="tei tei-q">“Opinionists,”</span> as they did
not dictate any doctrines; but only deduced opinions from
what had already been settled in the canon of the Talmud.
The Opinionists were succeeded by the Sublime Doctors, who
were in turn replaced by the ordinary Rabbis. In addition to
the Talmud there has been handed down a vast amount of
Jewish learning, such as the Bereitha, the Tosephtoth or appendices,
the Mechilta or traditions unknown to Rabbi Judah
the Holy, and the commentaries Sifra and Sifre. Of these
the Jews regard the Bereitha as second to the Mishna. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
mark of Bereitha is <span class="tei tei-q">‘the sages learned,’</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">‘it is once learned,’</span>
or <span class="tei tei-q">‘it is learned in another one.’</span> And everything which is not
disputed of all these things is an established decision. And
whatever is disputed goes according to the concluded decision.
What is disputed in the Bereitha, which is not questioned
in the Mishna, the decision is according to the Mishna. What
is disputed in the Mishna, and not questioned in the Bereitha,
is not to be decided according to the Bereitha. And thus it is
said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘If Rabbi Judah the Holy did not teach it, whence could
Rabbi Chayya know it?’</span> The exception is, that when the decision
of Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Jacob, is given, it is regarded
as equal to the Mishna. In 102 questions the decision
is always with him.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The period during which both the Jerusalem and Babylon
Talmuds were compiled was a season of comparative peace
for the Jews. From the death of Rabbi Judah the Holy until
Constantine ascended the throne the schools in Tiberias were
unmolested. Judah was succeeded in the Patriarchate by
Gamaliel; and he in turn gave way to Judah the second. Being
inferior in learning to some of his own Rabbis, the splendor
of his Patriarchate was eclipsed by the superior talents
of Simon Ben Laches and Rabbi Jochanan. From that time
the Patriarchate gradually sank in estimation, till the struggles
for unlimited power, and the rapacity of the Rabbis,
brought the office into contempt, and caused the Emperor
Honorius in one of his laws to brand them as <span class="tei tei-q">“Devastators.”</span>
Still, with a loyal affection to the race of Israel, the Jews,
wherever scattered in the West, looked to Tiberias as their
Zion, and willingly taxed themselves for the support of its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Rabbinical schools. The Jews in the East regarded the Prince
of the Captivity or Patriarch of Babylon as their centre and
chief. He rose to power between the abandonment of the
Mesopotamian provinces by Hadrian and the rise of the Persian
kingdom. He presided over his subjects with viceregal
power and a splendid court. Rabbis were his satraps, and
the wise and learned his officers and councillors. Wealth
flowed in upon his people, who were engaged in every kind
of commerce. One of his merchants in Babylon was said to
have had 1,000 vessels on sea and 1,000 cities on shore. There
was for a time a spirit of rivalry between the spiritual courts
of Tiberias and Babylon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On one occasion there was an open schism about the calculation
of the Paschal feast. The struggle for supremacy
took place when Simon, son of Gamaliel, who claimed descent
from Aaron, was Patriarch of Tiberias, and Ahia, who
claimed descent from King David, was Prince of the Captivity.
His two most learned men were Hananiah, the rector
of Nahar-pakod, and Judah, son of Bethuriah. To humble
these men was the aim of Simon. Accordingly he sent two
legates with three letters to Babylon. The first letter was
given to Hananiah. It was addressed, <span class="tei tei-q">“To your holiness.”</span>
Flattered by the title, he politely asked the reason of their
visit. <span class="tei tei-q">“To learn your system of instruction.”</span> Still more
gratified, he paid them every attention. Availing themselves
of their advantage, the legates used every effort to undermine
his teaching and lessen his authority. Hananiah, enraged by
their conduct, summoned an assembly, and denounced their
treachery. The people cried out, <span class="tei tei-q">“That which thou hast
built, thou canst not so soon pull down; the hedge which thou
hast planted, thou canst not pluck up without injury to thyself.”</span>
Hananiah demanded their objections to his teaching.
They answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast dared to fix intercalations and
new moons, by which nonconformity has arisen between
Babylon and Palestine.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“So did Rabbi Akiba,”</span> said Hananiah,
<span class="tei tei-q">“when in Babylon.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Akiba,”</span> they replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“left not
his like in Palestine.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Neither,”</span> cried Hananiah, <span class="tei tei-q">“have I
left my equal in Palestine.”</span> The legates then produced their
second letter, in which it was written, <span class="tei tei-q">“That which thou hast
left a kid is grown up a strong horned goat.”</span> Hananiah was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
struck dumb. Rabbi Isaac, one of the legates, ran, and
mounted the reading desk. <span class="tei tei-q">“These,”</span> said he, calling them
out aloud, <span class="tei tei-q">“are the holy days of God, and these the holy days
of Hananiah.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The people began to murmur. Rabbi Nathan, the second
legate, arose, and read the verse of Isaiah, <span class="tei tei-q">“Out of Zion shall
go forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”</span>
Then in a mocking voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“Out of Babylon shall go forth
the Law, and the Word of the Lord from Nahor-pakod.”</span> The
congregation was in an uproar. <span class="tei tei-q">“Alter not the word of God”</span>
was the universal shout. The legates then produced the third
letter, threatening excommunication to all who would not
obey their decrees. They further said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The learned have
sent us, and commanded us to say, if he will submit, well; if
not, utter at once the Cherem.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> Also set the choice before
our brethren in foreign parts. If they will stand by us, well;
if not, let them ascend their high places. Let Ahia build them
an altar, and Hananiah (a Levite) sing at the sacrifice, and
let them at once set themselves apart, and say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘We have no
portion in the God of Israel.’</span> ”</span> From every side the cry
arose, <span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven preserve us from heresy; we have still a portion
in the Israel of God.”</span> The authority of Tiberias was
then recognized as supreme. But when Babylon was afterward
politically severed from the Roman power in the West,
and fell to the Persians, the Prince of the Captivity represented
the Jews of the East as their independent head.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The canon of the Talmud was closed in a season of opulence
and repose. This scene, however, speedily changed. Gloomy
and dark days were followed by a storm of persecution from
the Persian kings, Yesdigird and Firuz <span class="tei tei-q">“the tyrant.”</span> When
their schools were closed, the Jews clung more closely to the
Talmud than before. Although never formally adopted by
any general council, all orthodox Jews embraced it as supplying
a want which they felt. And they have adhered to it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
through long and dreary centuries, despite the rack and fire
of the Inquisitor, and the contempt and scorn of a hostile
world. The Talmud has been periodically banned, and often
publicly burned, from the age of the Emperor Justinian till
the time of Pope Clement VIII. In the year 1569 the famous
Jewish library in Cremona was plundered, and 12,000 copies of
the Talmud and other Jewish writings were committed to the
flames. The first to demand for it toleration and free inquiry
was Reuchlin. He declared that he must oppose the destruction
of <span class="tei tei-q">“a book written by Christ's nearest relations.”</span> Before
him, Haschim II, Caliph of Cordova in the close of the
tenth century, had ordered it to be translated into Arabic.
This was done by Rabbi Joseph, the son of Rabbi Moses, surnamed
<span class="tei tei-q">“clad in a sack,”</span> because he was thus meanly clad
when his great talents were discovered.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The study of the Talmud has the most fascinating influence
over the Jewish mind, and if the latter is to be comprehended,
the teaching which moulds it must be clearly understood.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Everyone,”</span> say the Jews, <span class="tei tei-q">“is bound to divide the
time of his study into three parts—one-third is to be devoted
to the written law, one-third to the Mishna, and one-third to
Gemara.”</span> To understand it in accordance with the thirteen
rules of interpretation, it takes a study of seven hours a day
for seven years. They also say that it is lawful to rend a man
ignorant of the Talmud <span class="tei tei-q">“like a fish.”</span> Israelites are forbidden
to marry the daughter of such a one, as <span class="tei tei-q">“she is no better than
a beast.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To obviate arguments furnished by its own statements
against itself, its adherents make a distinction between its decisions,
its directions, and its legendary or romance part,—a
distinction fatal to its claim of equality with Holy Scripture.
For this legendary part some of the ancient Rabbis had but
little respect. Rabbi Joshua, son of Levi, says, <span class="tei tei-q">“He who
writes it down will have no part in the world to come; he who
explains it will be scorched.”</span> Maimonides also says, <span class="tei tei-q">“If one
of the many foolish rabbis reads these histories and proverbs,
he will find an explanation unnecessary, for to a fool everything
is right, and he finds no difficulty anywhere. And if a
really wise man reads them, there will be but two ways in
which he will consider them. If he takes them in their literal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sense and thinks them bad, he will say, This is foolishness,
and in so doing he says nothing at all against the foundation
of the faith.”</span> The School of Shammai, who lived before
Christ, and the School of Hillel, who lived till eight<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> years
after His birth, are brought forward as contradictory in their
decisions. Like Christian leaders in later times, they strove
to exceed each other in learning and pride. Hillel, called also
the second Ezra, was born in Babylon. His thirst for learning
drove him to Jerusalem. He was so poor he could not
fee the porter of the college. So he used to listen at the window.
One bitter winter's night he became insensible from
cold, and the snow falling fast covered him up. The darkened
window called the attention of those inside to his form without.
He was then brought in, and soon restored to life. It
is said that afterward <span class="tei tei-q">“he had eighty scholars: thirty of them
were fit that the divine glory should rest upon them, as it did
upon Moses—thirty others were worthy that the sun should
stand still for them, as it did for Joshua—and twenty were of
a form between.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By a sort of legal fiction both schools are supposed to be
of equal authority. A Bath Kol<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> or holy echo, supplying the
place of departed Urim and Thummim, and of oracles long
since silent, is related to have established it. <span class="tei tei-q">“There came
forth a divine voice at Jabneh and said, The words of the
one and of the other are the words of the living God, but the
certain determination of the thing is according to the School
of Hillel, and whosoever transgresseth against the words of
the School of Hillel deserves death.”</span> Both schools were
Pharisees, but the School of Shammai was the straiter sect.
Seven different shades of character have been attributed to
the Pharisees of that age: there were those who served God
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from selfishness—those who did it gradually—those who
avoided the sight of women—saints in office—those who asked
you to name some duty which they ought to perform—those
who were pious from fear of God—and those who were pious
from love of Him. Popular opinion differed with regard to
them. Some said, <span class="tei tei-q">“If only two men be saved, one must be a
Pharisee”</span>; while others defined a Pharisee to be <span class="tei tei-q">“one who
wished to play the part of Zimri, and to claim the reward of
Phinehas.”</span> The great opponents of the Pharisees were the
Sadducees, who arose <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 300, and were followers of Baithos
and Sadok. Their rivals on the other side were the Mehestanites,
who returned from the Captivity versed in the
doctrines of Zoroaster—in astrology, and in the influences
of good and bad spirits. To these might be added the Misraimites,
who studied the Kabbala, specially in reference to
the forms of letters. The letter Koph, for example, has its
curved part severed from its stem, and thus teaches that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
door of mercy is always open to the penitent.”</span> The numerical
value of the letters of Messiah and Nachash (serpent) is the
same, and this teaches that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Messiah will overcome the
Serpent.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Kabbalists believed nothing but what they <span class="tei tei-q">“received.”</span>
Their teachers received from the prophets—the prophets received
from angels—David from the Angel Michael, Moses
from Metatron, Isaac from Raphael, Shem from Yophiel—and
the angels themselves from God. The Metatron is the connecting
link between the Divine Spirit and the world of matter.
It resembles the Demiurgos of the Gnostics. It is the
mystical expression for the Being that forms a union between
God and nature, or, as the Zohar puts it, between the <span class="tei tei-q">“King
and the Queen.”</span> There were also the Essenes, who allegorized
the Law; the Hellenists, who mixed it up with
Greek philosophy; the Therapeutists, who thought supreme
happiness to be meditation; the political Herodians; the
Zealots; and other petty sects who formed the great mass of
the people, and held either with or against the two great
schools. The decisions of both schools are remarkable for
their concise brevity. A phrase suggests many thoughts—a
single word awakes a whole train of reasoning. A German
writer has said of the Mishna, that <span class="tei tei-q">“it is a firmament of telescopic
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stars, containing many a cluster of light, which no unaided
eye has ever resolved.”</span> Some of its sayings are of
touching beauty. Such are the words of Rabbi Tarphon,
<span class="tei tei-q">“The day is short—the labor vast;—but the laborers are
slothful, though the reward is great, and the Master of the
house presseth for despatch.”</span> Some of its sayings are extravagant—some
are loathsome—and some are blasphemous.
But mixed up as they are together, they form an extraordinary
monument of <span class="tei tei-q">“human industry, human wisdom, and human
folly.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Talmud contains a system of casuistry in reference to
the doctrines of intention and legal uncleanness. It proportions
responsibility to the amount of intention, and thereby
hands over tender consciences to the control of the Rabbis. It
proportions legal uncleanness to every degree of approach to
the source, or, as it is called, <span class="tei tei-q">“the father”</span> of uncleanness; and
this again renders necessary continual appeals to the decision
of the Rabbis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Predestination and free will are both taught. <span class="tei tei-q">“Everything
is in the hands of heaven, except the fear of heaven.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“All
things are ordained of God, but men's actions are their own.”</span>
When men wish to sin they are enjoined to go to a place
where they are unknown, and to clothe themselves in black
so as not to dishonor God openly. Hereditary sin was denied
by the early Kabbalists, but the later ones allow it. They believe
that all souls were created in Adam, and therefore partake
of his fall. Every kind of philosophy known at the time
of its compilation is more or less introduced into the Talmud,
and all more or less tinged with Magian superstition. From
this superstition grew the mysticism of the Jewish schools.
All the arts and sciences, under some form or other, are alluded
to, and references to historical events abound in its
pages. When it is dangerous to speak of them openly they
are veiled under some figure known only to the initiated.
Some observations seem to anticipate future discoveries. The
Antipodes are hinted at. And the Jerusalem Gemara says that
Alexander the Great was represented as carrying a ball in his
hand because he believed the figure of the earth to be a sphere.
Astronomy is fully discussed. The planets are <span class="tei tei-q">“moving
stars.”</span> Mercury is <span class="tei tei-q">“the star”</span>; Venus, <span class="tei tei-q">“splendor”</span>; Mars,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“redness”</span>; Jupiter, <span class="tei tei-q">“rightness”</span>; Saturn, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Sabbath star.”</span>
The signs of the Zodiac have the same names as are now used.
The Galaxy is <span class="tei tei-q">“the river of light.”</span> Comets are <span class="tei tei-q">“burning arrows.”</span>
And it is said that when a comet passes through Orion
it will destroy the world. A certain Ishmaelite merchant is
related to have invited Rabba to come and see where the
heavens and the earth touched. Rabba took his bread basket
and placed it on the window while he prayed. He afterward

Astrology is treated as a science which governs the life of
man. The stars make men wise. The stars make them rich.
<span class="tei tei-q">“A man born on the first day of the week will excel in only
one quality. He that is born on the second day will be an
angry man, because on that day the waters were divided. He
that is born on the third day of the week will be rich and
licentious, because on it the herbs were created. He that is
born on the fourth day will be wise and of good memory, because
on that day the lights were hung up. He that is born
on the fifth day will be charitable, because on that day the
fishes and fowls were created. He that is born on the Sabbath,
on the Sabbath he also shall die, because on his account
they profaned the great Sabbath day.”</span> Rabba bar Shila says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“He shall be eminently holy.”</span> Rabbi Chanina says, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
influence of the stars makes wise, the influence of the stars
makes rich, and Israel is under the influence of the stars.”</span>
Rabbi Jochanan says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Israel is not under the influence of
the stars. Whence is it proved? <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thus saith the Lord, Learn
not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs
of heaven, for the heathen are dismayed at them’</span> (Jer. x. 2).
The heathen, but not Israel.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“An eclipse of the sun is an
evil sign to the nations of the world; an eclipse of the moon
is an evil sign to Israel, for Israel reckons by the moon, the
nations of the world by the sun.”</span> It is also said that Saturn
and Mars are the baleful stars, and whosoever begins a work,
or walks in the way, when either of these two is in the ascendant,
will come to sorrow. Astrology naturally leads to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
amulets and charms. Amulets are divided into two classes,
approved and disapproved. An approved amulet is <span class="tei tei-q">“one that
has cured three persons, or has been made by a man who has
cured three persons with other amulets.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Charms are abundantly provided against accidents. <span class="tei tei-q">“For
bleeding of the nose let a man be brought to a priest named
Levi, and let the name Levi be written backward. If there
be not a priest, get a layman, who is to write backward <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ana
pipi Shila bar Sumki,’</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">‘Taam dli bemi ceseph, taam dli

of an old bed, and paper, and saffron, and the red part of the
inside of a palm tree, and let him burn them together, and
let him take some wool, and twist two threads, and dip them
in vinegar, and roll them in ashes, and put them into his nose;
or let him look out for a stream of water which flows from
east to west, and let him go and stand with one leg on each
side of it, and let him take with his right hand some mud from
under his left foot, and with his left hand from under his right
foot, and let him twist two threads of wool, and dip them in
the mud, and put them into his nose.”</span> If a man be bitten by
a mad dog he must die, unless some remedy be found for him.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Abai says he must take the skin of a male adder, and write
upon it, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I, M, the son of the woman N, upon the skin of a
male adder, write against thee, Kanti Kanti Klirus, but some
say, Kandi Kandi Klurus, Lord of Hosts. Amen. Selah.’</span>
Let him also cast off his clothes, and bury them in a graveyard
for twelve months of a year; then let him take them up, and
burn them in a furnace, and let him strew the ashes at the
parting of the roads. And during these twelve months let
him only drink out of a brass tube, lest he see the phantom
form of the demon, and he be endangered. This was done by
Abba, the son of Martha—he is Abba, the son of Manjumi.
His mother made him a tube of gold.”</span>

Magic naturally follows from such teaching. Abba Benjamin
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“If leave had been given to see the hurtful demons,
no creature could stand before them.”</span> Abbai says, <span class="tei tei-q">“They are
more than we are, and stand against us, like the trench round
a garden bed.”</span> Rav Huni says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Everyone has a thousand

against them, bruised legs are from them.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever
wishes to know their existence, let him take ashes passed
through a sieve, and strew them in his bed, and in the morning
he will see the marks of a cock's claws. Whosoever wishes
to see them, let him take the inner covering of a black cat,
the kitten of a first-born black cat, which is also the kitten of
a first-born, and let him burn it in the fire, and powder it, and
fill his eyes with it, and he will see them. And let him pour the
powder into an iron tube, and seal it with an iron signet, lest
they steal any of it, and let him seal the mouth of it, lest any
harm ensue. Rav Bibi bar Abbai did thus, and he was harmed,
but the Rabbis prayed for mercy, and he was healed.”</span> Arts
of sorcery are attributed to the Rabbis. They are represented
as having the power to create both men and melons. One of
them is said to have changed a woman into an ass, and ridden
the ass to market, when another sorcerer changed the ass
again into a woman.

This sorcery is traced to Abraham, who is said (Gen. xxv. 6)
to have given his sons gifts. These gifts are stated to have
been the arts of sorcery. Legends abound everywhere
throughout the Talmud. Rabbi Judah said, Rav said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Everything
that God created in the world, He created male and
female. And thus he did with leviathan, the piercing serpent,
and leviathan the crooked serpent. He created them male
and female; but if they had been joined together they would
have desolated the whole world. What then did the Holy
One do? He enervated the male leviathan, and slew the female,
and salted her for the righteous in the time to come,
for it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘And He shall slay the dragon that is in the sea’</span>
(Isa. xxvii. 1). Likewise, with regard to behemoth upon a
thousand mountains, He created them male and female; but
if they had been joined together they would have desolated
the whole world. What then did the Holy One do? He
enervated the male behemoth, and made the female barren,
and preserved her for the righteous in the time to come. That
period is to be a season of great feasting. The liquor to be
drunk will be apple-wine of more than seventy years old. The
cup of David alone will hold one hundred and twenty-one logs.
It is related that a Rabbi once saw in a desert a flock of geese
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
so fat that their feathers fell off, and the rivers flowed in fat.
He said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Shall we have part of you in the world to
come?’</span> One of them lifted up a wing and another a leg, to
signify the parts we shall have. We should otherwise have
had all parts of these geese, but that their sufferings are owing
to us. It is our iniquities that have delayed the coming of the
Messiah, and these geese suffer greatly by reason of their excessive
fat, which daily increases, and will increase till the
Messiah comes.”</span>

Rabba bar Chama says that he once saw <span class="tei tei-q">“a bird so tall,
that its head reached to the sky and its legs to the bottom of
the ocean.”</span> The water in which it stood was so deep that a
carpenter's axe which had fallen in seven years before had not
then reached the bottom. He also saw <span class="tei tei-q">“a frog as large as a
village containing sixty houses.”</span> This frog was swallowed
up by a serpent, and this serpent in turn by a crow; this crow
flew, and perched upon a cedar, and this cedar was as broad
as sixteen wagons abreast. There is also an account of a fish
which was killed by a worm. This fish, when driven ashore,
destroyed sixty cities, and sixty cities ate of it, and sixty cities
salted it, and with its bones the ruined cities were rebuilt.
Stories are also told of fishes with eyes like the moon, and of
horned fishes three hundred miles in length. These stories are
intended to confirm the text, <span class="tei tei-q">“They that go down to the sea in
ships, that do business in great waters; these see the works of
the Lord and his wonders in the deep”</span> (Ps. cvii. 23, 24). To
illustrate the statement of Amos (iii. 8), a story is told of a lion
which one of the Cæsars wished to see. At 400 miles distance
he roared, and the walls of Rome fell. At 300 miles he again
roared, and all the people fell on their backs, and their teeth
fell out, and Cæsar fell off his throne. Cæsar then prayed for
his removal to a safer distance.

The Talmud informs us that <span class="tei tei-q">“a young unicorn, one day
old, is as large as Mount Tabor.”</span> Consequently Noah had
great difficulty in saving an old one alive. He could not get
it into the ark, so he bound it by its horn to the side of the
ark. At the same time Og, King of Bashan (being one of
the antediluvians), was saved by riding on its back. We are
further informed that he was one of the giants who came
from the intermarriage of angels with the daughters of men.

His footsteps were forty miles long, and one of his teeth
served to make a couch for Abraham. When the Israelites
came against him under the command of Moses, he inquired
the size of their camp, and hearing that it was three miles in
extent he tore up a mountain of that size, to hurl it upon them.
Grasshoppers were, however, sent to bore holes in it, so that it
fell over his head on to his neck. His teeth also grew and
were entangled in the rocks, as the Psalmist says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast
broken the teeth of the ungodly”</span> (Ps. iii. 7). He is also said
to be identical with Eliezer the servant of Abraham, and to
have been, like Enoch, translated to Paradise. This account,
however, differs widely from the statements of the Jerusalem
Targum on the Book of Numbers (xxi. 34).

parts of the earth; and that he was created with two faces, as
it is written, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast beset me behind and before”</span> (Ps.
cxxxix. 5). The Rabbis further state that he was formed in
two parts, one male and one female. His height before his
fall reached to the firmament, but after his fall God put his
hand upon him, and compressed him small. In the tenth hour
after he was made, he sinned; and in the twelfth he was driven
out of Paradise. Abraham is said to have put Sarah into a
box when he brought her into Egypt, that none should see
her beauty. At the custom-house toll was demanded. Abraham
said he was ready to pay. The custom-house officers

clothes.”</span> They said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou bringest gold.”</span> He said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will

Abraham, it is also said, had a precious stone hung around

wounded was obliged to pay him for letting his blood.”</span> When

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
up a stone and flung it at the judge. He then bid the judge
to pay the fine, which was now due to him for letting his blood,
to the man who had first wounded him. There was a public
bed in Sodom, and every stranger was obliged to lie in it. If
his legs were too long for it, they were cut off; and if too
short, they were racked out to the proper length. When a
traveller came, each citizen, to show his hospitality, was
obliged to give him a coin with his name written upon it. The
traveller was then deprived of bread; and when he had died
of starvation, the citizens came, and each one took back his
own money. The Sodomites thus kept up their character for
liberality.

Wonderful stories are told of the manna. The manna is
said to have fallen from heaven, accompanied by showers of
pearls and precious stones. It tasted to everyone according
to his desire. If one wished for fat fowl, so it tasted. If another
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other wished for honey, so it tasted, as it is written, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou
hast lacked nothing”</span> (Deut. xi. 7). The Targum of Jonathan
goes on to inform us, <span class="tei tei-q">“At the fourth hour, when the sun had
waxed hot upon it, it melted and became streams of water,
which flowed away into the great sea, and wild animals that
were clean, and cattle, came to drink of it, and the children of
Israel hunted and ate them”</span> (Exod. xvi. 21). It is further
related that the Queen of Sheba (whom the Rabbis labor to
prove to have been the King of Sheba) wished to test the
knowledge of Solomon who had written on botany <span class="tei tei-q">“from the
cedar to the hyssop.”</span> She once stood at a distance from him
with two exquisite wreaths of flowers—one artificial, one
natural. They were so much alike that the King looked perplexed,
and the courtiers looked melancholy. Observing a
swarm of bees on the window, he commanded it to be opened.
All the bees lighted on the natural and not one on the artificial
wreath. Solomon is also said to have sent Benaiah, the son
of Jehoiada, to bind Aschmedai, the king of the devils. After
deceiving the devil with wine he made him reveal the secret
of the Schamir, or little worm, which can cleave the hardest
stone. And by the aid of this worm Solomon built the Temple.
The devil afterward asked Solomon for his signet ring,
and when he had given it to him the devil stretched one wing
up to the firmament and the other to the earth, and jerked
Solomon four hundred miles away. Then assuming the aspect
of Solomon, he seated himself on his throne. After Solomon
had again obtained it, he wrote, <span class="tei tei-q">“What profit hath a man of

A story is told of Nebuzaradan, that he saw the blood of
Zecharias bubbling in the court of the priests. When he asked

bullocks and lambs. When he had ordered bullocks and lambs
to be slain, the blood of Zecharias still bubbled and reeked
above theirs. The priests then confessed that it was the blood
of a priest and prophet and judge, whom they had slain. He
then commanded eighty thousand priests to be put to death.
The blood, however, still continued to bubble. God then said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Is this man, who is but flesh and blood, filled with pity toward

The Talmud teaches that evil spirits, devils, and goblins
are the offspring of Adam. They are said to fly about in all
directions. They know from eavesdropping what is to come
in the future. Like men, they eat, drink, and multiply. They
are represented as playing men awkward tricks. One is stated
to have broken a vessel of wine, and to have spilled it on the
ground. The Rabbis, however, afterward compelled him to
pay for it. People are forbidden to ride oxen fresh from the
stall, as Satan dances between their horns. Men are forbidden
to salute their companions by night, lest they may turn
out to be devils. It is also commanded to shake out, before
drinking, some water from the vessel, to get rid of what is
sipped by the evil spirits. It is, however, permitted to consult
Satan on week-days. He is considered identical with the
Angel of Death. But he is described as having no power over
those engaged in reading the law. Many of his devices are
related in the Talmud, whereby he made learned men leave
off reading, and then he snatched away their souls. A story
is told of the attempt of Rabbi Joshua, the son of Levi, and
Satan to deceive each other about the Rabbi's place in paradise.
Finally, however, Satan managed to take away his life,
whereupon the voice of Elijah is heard shouting in heaven,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Make room for the son of Levi,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Make room for the son
of Levi.”</span> The Angel of Death is represented as standing at
the head of the dying man. He has a drawn sword in his hand,
on which is a drop of gall. When the dying man sees it, he
shudders and opens his mouth. The Angel of Death then lets
it fall into his mouth. The sick man dies, corrupts, and becomes
pale. Three days the soul flies about the body, thinking
to return to it, but after it sees the appearance of the face
changed, it leaves it and goes away.

is as painful as a needle in a living one. The Talmud still
further states that there are three voices continually heard—the
voice of the sun as he rolls in his orbit—the voice of the
multitudes of Rome—and the voice of the soul as it leaves the
body. The Rabbis, however, prayed for mercy on the soul,
and this voice has ceased. Instances are also given of men
overhearing the conversations of the dead, and receiving profit
from them. A man is said to have heard one girl tell another
in the grave, that those who sowed their crops at a particular
time would find their harvests fail. So he took care to sow
at another time, and he had an abundant yield. It is also said
that every Friday evening a second soul enters into the bodies
of men, and that it remains to the end of the Sabbath, when
it departs. The evidence of this second soul is shown by an
increased appetite for eating and drinking.

Good angels are stated to be daily created out of the stream
of glory which flows from the throne of God, and they sing
a new song, and vanish; as it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“They are new every

Rabbis also say that angels are created out of every word which
proceeds from the mouth of God; as it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“By the word
of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them
by the breath of His mouth”</span> (Ps. xxxiii. 6). The following
story is also told: In the hour when Nimrod, the impious,

before the blessed God, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord of the world, I will go down and
cool the flame, and deliver the righteous One from the furnace
of fire.”</span> The blessed God said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am the ONE in
this world, and he is the one in his world. It becomes the ONE
to deliver the one.”</span> But as the blessed God deprives no one
of his reward, He said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt be deemed worthy to
deliver three of his posterity.”</span> Rabbi Simon, the Shilonite,
taught, <span class="tei tei-q">“In the hour that Nebuchadnezzar, the impious, cast
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah into the midst of the fiery
furnace, Jorkemo, the prince of hail, stood up before the blessed
God, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I will go down and cool the flame, and deliver
the righteous ones from the furnace of fire.’</span> To him said
Gabriel, <span class="tei tei-q">‘The power of the blessed One is not so, since thou
art the prince of hail, and everyone knows that waters quench
fire; but I, the prince of fire, will go down and cool inwardly,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and heat outwardly, and I will make a wonder within a wonder.’</span> ”</span>
To him said the blessed God, <span class="tei tei-q">“Go down.”</span> In the
same hour Gabriel began and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“And the truth of the Lord
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">endureth</span></em> for ever”</span> (Ps. cxvii. 2).

Israelites are forbidden to pray in the Syriac language, as
the angels do not understand it, and consequently cannot carry
their petitions to God. Gabriel, however, is acquainted with it,
as he taught Joseph the seventy languages. The chief of all the
angels is said to be the Metatron, who once received fiery blows
from another angel called Ampiel. With regard to heaven, the
Rabbis teach that Egypt is four hundred miles long and broad,
the Morians' land is sixty times larger than Egypt, and the
world is sixty times larger than the Morians' land; heaven
is sixty times larger than the world, and hell is sixty times
larger than heaven. It follows that the <span class="tei tei-q">“whole world is but
a pot-lid to hell.”</span> Yet some say that hell is immeasurable, and
some say heaven is immeasurable. It was a pearl amongst
the sayings of a Rabbi. <span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven is not like this world, for in
it there is neither eating, nor drinking, nor marriage, nor increasing,
nor trafficking, nor hate, nor envy, nor heart-burnings;
but the just shall sit with their crowns on their heads,
and enjoy the splendors of the Shechinah.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hell is said to have three doors,—one in the wilderness, one
in the sea, and one in Jerusalem. In the wilderness, as it
is written, <span class="tei tei-q">“They, and all that appertained to them, went down
alive into the pit”</span> (Num. xvi. 33). In the sea, as it is written,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice”</span>
(Jonah ii. 3). In Jerusalem, as it is written, <span class="tei tei-q">“Saith the Lord
whose fire is in Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem”</span> (Is. xxxi.
9). The school of Rabbi Ishmael teaches that the <span class="tei tei-q">“fire in
Zion”</span> is hell and <span class="tei tei-q">“His furnace in Jerusalem”</span> is the gate of
hell. It is also taught that the fire of hell has no power over
the sinners in Israel, and that the fire of hell has no power over
the disciples of the wise. It is again, however, stated that the
Israelites who sin with their bodies, and the Gentiles who
sin with their bodies, go to hell, and are punished there twelve
months. After their body is wasted, and their soul is burned,
the wind scatters them beneath the soles of the righteous, as it
is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“And ye shall tread down the wicked: for they shall
be ashes under the soles of your feet”</span> (Mal. iv. 3). Heretics—deniers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the resurrection—Epicureans, and other sinners,
shall be perpetually tormented <span class="tei tei-q">“where their worm dieth
not and their fire is not quenched.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The doctrine of the resurrection is clearly taught in the Talmud.
As for the last judgment, the following story is told:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Said Antoninus to Rabbi, The body and soul can free themselves
from judgment. How? The body can say, The soul
sinned from the time it separated from me, while I lay as a
stone in the grave. And the soul can say, The body sinned
from the time it separated from me, while I flew in the air as a
bird.”</span> He replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will give you an example to which it
is like. It is like a king of flesh and blood, who has a beautiful
garden, and in which are pleasant fruits, and he placed two
watchmen therein, of whom one was lame and the other was
blind. Said the lame to the blind, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I see pleasant fruits in the
garden; come, and let me sit upon thee, and let us go and eat.’</span> ”</span>
The lame sat upon the blind, and they went and ate. After
some days the lord of the garden came, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Where are
my pleasant fruits?”</span> The lame said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have no legs to go to
them.”</span> The blind said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have no eyes to see them.”</span> What
did he do? He set the lame upon the blind, and judged them
as one. So the blessed God will return the soul into the body,
and judge them as one, as it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“He shall call to the
heavens from above and to the earth, that he may judge his
people”</span> (Ps. iv. 4). He shall call to the heavens from above,
that is the soul; and to the earth that he may judge his people,
that is, the body. After the resurrection men will live without
work or weariness of body, their houses shall be of precious
stones, and their beds of silk, and the rivers shall run with wine
and perfumed oil.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Talmud often contradicts Holy Scripture. It says that
they are in error who believe the Bible account of the sons of
Reuben, of the sons of Eli, and of the sons of Samuel. It
allows usury, and the passing of children through the fire to
Moloch. It permits deceit, and supports it with the text,
<span class="tei tei-q">“With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure, and with the
froward thou wilt show thyself unsavory”</span> (2 Sam. xxii. 27).
The Rabbis teach hatred of Christians and Gentiles. Instead
of saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“In the presence of the king,”</span> they are taught to
say, <span class="tei tei-q">“In the presence of the dog.”</span> A Jew who bears witness
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
against another Jew before a Gentile is publicly cursed. A
Jew is also released from any oath he may swear to a Gentile.
It is only permitted a Jewish physician to heal Gentiles for the
sake of the fee, or for the practice of medicine, but it is not
allowed to save their lives in seasons of danger. Their marriage
is no marriage; and their butchers' meat is only carrion.
It is wrong to invite them into a Jewish house; and it is not
needful to restore what they have lost. When the ox of a Jew
gores the ox of a Gentile, the Jew is free; but if the ox of a
Gentile gores the ox of a Jew, the Gentile must pay the full
cost. A story is told of a Rabbi who sold a number of palm-trees
to a Gentile, and afterward ordered his servant to cut off
some pieces from them. <span class="tei tei-q">“For,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Gentile knows
their number, but he does not know whether they be thick or
thin.”</span>

The precepts binding on the sons of Noah are stated to be
seven: to do justice; to bless the name of God; to avoid idolatry;
to flee from fornication and adultery; to abstain from
blood-shedding; not to rob; and not to eat a member of a living
animal. An account is given of the river Sambation, which
flows with stones all the six days of the week, but rests on the
Sabbath day. Examples are also furnished of gluttony and
drunkenness. The paunches of some Rabbis grew so big, that,
when put together, a pair of oxen might go between them.
A story is also related of one Rabbi killing another in a
drunken fit, and then working a miracle which restored him to
life. In the following year he again invited the Rabbi to drink
with him, but he declined, on the ground that <span class="tei tei-q">“miracles are
not wrought every day.”</span> Instances are also given of the
anguish of Rabbis in the prospect of death. They express
themselves as being without hope of salvation, and as having
the fear of hell before them.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Proverbs everywhere abound in the Talmud, and they are
generally replete with shrewd observation. <span class="tei tei-q">“The world subsists
through the breath of school children. Whosoever transgresses
the words of the Scribes is guilty of death. Whosoever
teaches a statute before his teachers ought to be bitten by
a serpent. There is no likeness between him who has bread in
his basket and him who has none. Rather be the head of foxes
than the tail of lions.”</span> This, however, again appears as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Rather be the tail of lions than the head of foxes.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The
righteous in the city is its splendor, its profit, its glory: when
he is departed, there is also departed the splendor, the profit,
and the glory.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Licentiousness in a house is as a worm in a
pumpkin.”</span> This reappears as <span class="tei tei-q">“Violence in a house is as a
worm in a pumpkin.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Thy friend has an acquaintance, and
the acquaintance of thy friend has also an acquaintance; be
discreet.”</span> The unworthy child of a good father is called
<span class="tei tei-q">“vinegar, the son of wine.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“If the opportunity fails the thief,
he deems himself honest. The cock and owl await together
the morning dawn. Says the cock to the owl, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Light profits
me, but how does it profit thee?’</span> Youth is a crown of roses,
old age a crown of thorns. Many preach well, but do not
practise well. It is the punishment of liars, that men don't
listen to them when they speak truth. Every man who is
proud is an idolater. To slander is to murder. Whosoever
humbles himself, God exalts him; whosoever exalts himself,
God humbles him. Men see every leprosy except their own.
He who daily looks after his property finds a coin. The post
does not honor the man; but the man the post. Every man is
not so lucky as to have two tables. Not what thou sayest
about thyself, but what thy companions say. The whole and
broken tables of the Law lie in the ark. The salt of money is
almsgiving. He who walks four cubits in the land of Israel
is sure of being a child of the world to come. The plague
lasted seven years, and no man died before his time. Let the
drunkard only go, he will fall of himself. Be rather the one
cursed than the one cursing. The world is like an inn, but the
world to come is the real home. The child loves its mother
more than its father: it fears its father more than its mother.
Repent one day before thy death. If your God is a friend of
the poor, why does He not support them? A wise man answered,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Their case is left in our hands, that we may thereby
acquire merits and forgiveness of sin.’</span> The house that does
not open to the poor shall open to the physician. He who visits
the sick takes away one-sixtieth part of their pain. Descend a
step in choosing a wife; mount a step in choosing a friend.
An old woman in a house is a treasure. Whosoever does not
persecute them that persecute him, whosoever takes an offence
in silence, whosoever does good from love, whosoever is cheerful
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
under his sufferings, they are friends of God, and of them
says the Scripture, <span class="tei tei-q">‘they shall shine forth as the sun at noonday.’</span> ”</span>
R. Phineas, son of Jair, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Industry brings purity—purity,
cleanness—cleanness, holiness—holiness, humbleness—humbleness,
fear of sin—and fear of sin, partaking of
the Holy Ghost.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ideas of God are gathered from the occupations which the
authors of the Talmud assign to him. <span class="tei tei-q">“The day contains
twelve hours. The first three hours the Holy One, blessed be
He, sits and studies the Law. The second three hours He sits
and judges the whole world. When He sees that the world
deserves destruction, He stands up from the throne of judgment,
and sits on the throne of mercy. The third three hours
He sits and feeds all the world, from the horns of the unicorns
to the eggs of the vermin. In the fourth three hours He sits
and plays with leviathan, for it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘The leviathan, whom
thou hast formed to play therein’</span> ”</span> (Ps. civ. 26). Rabbi Eliezer
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“The night has three watches, and at every watch the
Holy One, blessed be He, sits and roars like a lion; for it is
said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Lord shall roar from on high and utter His voice
from His holy habitation; He shall mightily roar upon His
habitation’</span> ”</span> (Jer. xxv. 30). Rabbi Isaac, the son of Samuel,
says in the name of Rav, <span class="tei tei-q">“The night has three watches, and
at every watch the Holy One, blessed be He, sits and roars
like a lion, and says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Woe is me, that I have laid desolate my
house, and burned my sanctuary, and sent my children into
captivity among the nations of the world!’</span> ”</span> He is described
as praying, and wearing phylacteries, and as having a special
place for weeping. <span class="tei tei-q">“Before the destruction of the Temple the
Holy One played with leviathan, but since the destruction of
the Temple, He plays with it no more. In the hour that the
Holy One remembers His children who are dwelling with
suffering among the nations, He lets two tears fall into the
Great Ocean, the noise of which is heard from one end of the
world to the other, and this is an earthquake.”</span> It is further
said that He <span class="tei tei-q">“braided the hair of Eve,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“shaved the
head of Sennacherib.”</span> He is represented as keeping school,
and teaching the sages. To this school the devils come, especially
Aschmedai, the king of the devils. In the discussions
that take place, God is said to be sometimes overcome by the
wiser Rabbis.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question of the Messiah is often brought forward. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
tradition of the school of Elijah is, that the world is to stand
six thousand years, two thousand years confusion, two thousand
years the Law, and two thousand years the days of the
Messiah.”</span> It is further said that the time for the coming of
the Messiah is expired. <span class="tei tei-q">“Rav says the appointed times are
long since past.”</span> The Jerusalem Talmud relates that <span class="tei tei-q">“it happened
once to a Jew, who was standing ploughing, that his
ox lowed before him. An Arab was passing, and heard its
voice. He said <span class="tei tei-q">‘O Jew! O Jew! unyoke thine ox, and loose
thy ploughshare, for the Temple is desolate.’</span> It lowed a second
time, and he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘O Jew! O Jew! yoke thine ox and bind thy
ploughshare, for King Messiah is born.’</span> The Jew said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘What
is His name?’</span> He answered <span class="tei tei-q">‘Menachem.’</span> He asked again,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘What is His father's name?’</span> He said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Hezekiah.’</span> He asked,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘From whence is He?’</span> He replied, <span class="tei tei-q">‘From the royal palace of
Bethlehem Judah.’</span> The Jew then went and saw him; but when
he went again, the mother told him <span class="tei tei-q">‘that the winds had borne
the child away.’</span> ”</span> The Babylon Talmud further states that
<span class="tei tei-q">“Rabbi Joshua, the son of Levi, found Elijah standing at the
door of the cave of Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai, and said to him,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Shall I reach the world to come?’</span> He answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘If the
Lord will.’</span> Rabbi Joshua, the son of Levi, said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I see two,
but I hear the voice of three.’</span> He also asked, <span class="tei tei-q">‘When will
Messiah come?’</span> Elijah answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Go and ask Himself.’</span>
Rabbi Joshua then said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Where does he sit?’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘At the gate
of Rome.’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘And how is he known?’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘He is sitting among
the poor and sick, and they open their wounds, and bind them
up again all at once: but he opens only one, and then he opens
another, for he thinks, Perhaps I may be wanted, and then I
must not be delayed.’</span> Rabbi Joshua went to him, and said,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Peace be upon thee, my Master, and my Lord.’</span> He answered,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Peace be upon thee, son of Levi.’</span> The Rabbi then asked him,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘When will my Lord come?’</span> He answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘To-day’</span> ”</span> (Ps.
xcv. 7). It is said that <span class="tei tei-q">“the bones of those who reckon the
appointed time of the Messiah must burst asunder.”</span> Again,
however, it is said that <span class="tei tei-q">“Elias told Rabbi Judah, the brother of
the pious Rabbi Salah, that the world would not stand less than
eighty-five years of Jubilee, and in the last year of Jubilee
the son of David will come.”</span> It is further stated that there
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are first to be the wars of the Dragon, and of Gog and Magog;
and that God will not renew the earth until seven thousand
years are completed. The Rabbis also say that when the Messiah
comes to fulfil the prophecy of riding upon an ass (Zech.
ix. 9), the ass shall be one of <span class="tei tei-q">“an hundred colors.”</span> As for the
return of the ten tribes to their own land, the Talmud in some
places asserts it, and in some places denies it. But it is said
that in the days of the Messiah all the Gentiles shall become
proselytes to the Jewish faith. The Rabbis are divided as to
the continuance of the Messiah; some say forty years, some
seventy years, some three generations, and some say that He
will continue as long as from the creation of the world or the
time of Noah <span class="tei tei-q">“up to the present time.”</span> Others say that the
kingdom of the Messiah will endure for thousands of years,
as <span class="tei tei-q">“when there is a good government it is not quickly dissolved.”</span>
It is also said that He shall die, and His kingdom descend
to His son and grandson. In proof of this opinion
Isaiah xlii. 4 is quoted: <span class="tei tei-q">“He shall not fail, nor be discouraged,
till He have set judgment in the earth.”</span> The lives of men will
be prolonged for centuries: <span class="tei tei-q">“He will swallow up death in
victory”</span> (Is. xxv. 8); and <span class="tei tei-q">“the child shall die an hundred
years old”</span> (Is. lxv. 20). The Talmud applies the former verse
to Israel, the latter verse to the Gentiles. The men of that
time will be two hundred ells high. This is said to be proved
by the word <span class="tei tei-q">“upright”</span> (Lev. xxvi. 13), <span class="tei tei-q">“upright”</span> being
applied to the supposed height of man before the fall. <span class="tei tei-q">“Moreover
the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun; and
the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven
days”</span> (Is. xxx. 26). The land of Israel will produce cakes
and clothes of the finest wool. The wheat will grow on Lebanon
as high as palm-trees; and a wind will be sent from God
to reduce it to fine flour for the support of those who gather
it; as it is said <span class="tei tei-q">“with the fat of kidneys of wheat”</span> (Deut.
xxxii. 14). Each kidney will be as large as <span class="tei tei-q">“the kidneys of
the fattest oxen.”</span> To prove that this is nothing wonderful,
an account is given of a rape seed in which a fox once brought
forth young. These young ones were weighed, and found to
be as heavy as sixty pounds of Cyprus weight. Lest these
statements should be thought a contradiction of the verse
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">There</span></em> is no new <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thing</span></em> under the sun”</span> (Eccles. i. 9), the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Rabbis say that it is just like the growth of mushrooms, toadstools,
and the delicate mosses on the branches of trees. Grapes
will also grow most luxuriantly; and in every cluster there
will be thirty jars of wine. Jerusalem will be built three miles
high; as it is written, <span class="tei tei-q">“It shall be lifted up”</span> (Zech. xiv. 10).
The gates of the city will be made of pearls and precious stones,
thirty ells high and thirty ells broad. A disciple of the Rabbis
once doubted whether precious stones could be found so large;
and shortly afterward, he saw an angel with similar stones, as
he was out at sea. On his return to land he related what he
had seen to Rabbi Jochanan. Whereupon the Rabbi said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Thou fool, if thou hadst not seen, thou hadst not believed;
thou mockest the words of the wise.”</span> He then <span class="tei tei-q">“lifted up his
eyes upon him, and he was made an heap of bones.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Said R. Samuel, the son of Nachman, R. Jochanan said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Three shall be called by the name of the Holy One; blessed
be He.”</span> And these are the Righteous, the Messiah, and Jerusalem.
The Righteous, as is said (Is. xliii. 7). The
Messiah, as it is written (Jer. xxiii. 6): <span class="tei tei-q">“And this is
His name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR
RIGHTEOUSNESS.”</span> Jerusalem, as it is written (Ezek.
xlviii. 35): <span class="tei tei-q">“It was round about eighteen thousand measures:
and the name of the city from that day shall be The LORD is
THERE.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the later editions of the Talmud the allusions to Christ
and Christianity are few and cautious, compared with the
earlier or unexpurgated copies. The last of these was published
at Amsterdam in 1645. In them our Lord and Saviour
is <span class="tei tei-q">“that one,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“such an one,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“a fool,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the leper,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the
deceiver of Israel,”</span> etc. Efforts are made to prove that He is
the son of Joseph Pandira before his marriage with Mary. His
miracles are attributed to sorcery, the secret of which He
brought in a slit in His flesh out of Egypt. His teacher is
said to have been Joshua, the son of Perachiah. This Joshua
is said to have afterward excommunicated him to the blast of
400 rams' horns, though he must have lived seventy years before
His time. Forty days before the death of Jesus a witness
was summoned by public proclamation to attest His innocence,
but none appeared. He is said to have been first stoned, and
then hanged on the eve of the Passover. His disciples are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
called heretics, and opprobrious names. They are accused of
immoral practices; and the New Testament is called a sinful
book. The references to these subjects manifest the most
bitter aversion and hatred.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Rabbis have laid down thirteen rules for the interpretation
of the Talmud. These rules form their system of logic.
They are as follows:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) <span class="tei tei-q">“Light and heavy,”</span> an argument from the less to the
greater. An example is furnished in the case of Miriam (Num.
xii. 14). <span class="tei tei-q">“If her father had but spit in her face, should she
not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp
seven days, and after that let her be received in again.”</span> The
argument is here drawn from the conduct of man, the less, to
that of God, the greater. The owner of an ox is also fined
more for his beast if it gores his neighbor's beast than if it eats
his neighbor's corn; since the tooth only means sustenance for
the stomach, but the horn means mischief.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) <span class="tei tei-q">“Equality,”</span> an argument from the similarity or identity
of words and impressions. An example is furnished in
Deut. xv. 12: <span class="tei tei-q">“If thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew
woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years, then in the
seventh year thou shalt let him free from thee.”</span> In the 18th
verse, when this law is again referred to, the man only is
mentioned; but as the woman was mentioned in the former
verse, it is concluded that the law applies equally to both.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3.) <span class="tei tei-q">“The building of the father,”</span> an argument from the
statements in (a) one place in the Law to other passages, which
are similar. An example is furnished in Exod. xii. 16, where
servile work is forbidden during the feast of unleavened bread,
and the conclusion is drawn that servile work is equally forbidden
in all festivals of the same nature. This mode of argument
is also applied to (b) two places in the Law, where one
place refers to the general proposition, and another to particulars
arising out of it. An example is furnished in Lev.
xv. 1, where a man with an issue is unclean, but in the 4th
verse this uncleanness is limited to his bed and his seat.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4.) <span class="tei tei-q">“Universal and particular.”</span> Where there is a general
and a special statement, the special binds the general. An
example is furnished in Lev. i. 2: <span class="tei tei-q">“If any man of you bring
an offering unto the Lord, ye shall bring your offering of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cattle, even of the herd and of the flock.”</span> Cattle (in the Hebrew
Behemah) includes both wild and tame. The special
terms <span class="tei tei-q">“herd”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“flock”</span> limit the offering to domesticated
animals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(5.) <span class="tei tei-q">“Particular and universal,”</span> or argument from the
special to the general. An example is furnished in Deut. xxii.
1: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go
astray: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy
brother.”</span> In the 3d verse, it is further commanded to restore
<span class="tei tei-q">“all lost things of thy brother's.”</span> Hence it is concluded, not
only his ox or his sheep, but that everything, which he has lost
is to be restored to him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(6.) <span class="tei tei-q">“Universal, particular and universal.”</span> Where there are
two universal statements with a particular statement between,
the particular limits the universals. An example is furnished
in Deut. xiv. 26, where, speaking of the application of the
second tithe, it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt bestow that money for
whatsoever thy soul lusteth after; for oxen, or for sheep, or
for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth.”</span>
The special limitation, between the two universal
permissions, is to productions of the land of Canaan.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(7.) <span class="tei tei-q">“The general that requires the special, and the special
that requires the general.”</span> An example is furnished in Lev.
xvii. 13: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whatsoever man ... hunteth and catcheth
any beast or fowl that may be eaten, he shall even pour out the
blood thereof, and cover it with dust.”</span> The word <span class="tei tei-q">“cover”</span>
or <span class="tei tei-q">“hide”</span> is again used in Gen. xviii. 17: <span class="tei tei-q">“Shall I hide from
Abraham that thing which I shall do?”</span> The conclusion is
drawn, that cover is restricted to the blood being hidden under
dust, and not put in any vessel. Again (Exod. xiii. 2):
<span class="tei tei-q">“Sanctify unto me all the first-born; whatever openeth the
womb among the children of Israel, both of man and beast,
it is mine.”</span> From this verse females might be included with
males. Reference is made to Deut. xv. 19, where it is found
<span class="tei tei-q">“All the firstling males.”</span> Still it is obscure, when there are
firstling females, about the males born afterward. Reference
is made to Exod. xxxiv. 19: <span class="tei tei-q">“All that openeth the matrix is
mine.”</span> Here all first-born are allowed. This, however, is too
general, and it is again restricted by the word males. And as
this is too general, it is again restricted by <span class="tei tei-q">“all that openeth
the matrix.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(8.) <span class="tei tei-q">“Whatsoever is taught in general and something special
is mentioned—it is mentioned to strengthen the general rule.”</span>
An example is furnished in Lev. xx. 2, where the worship of
Moloch is forbidden, and the penalty for the sin is death. The
conclusion drawn is, that such mention of a special form of
idolatry confirms the prohibition of all idolatry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(9.) <span class="tei tei-q">“When there is a general rule and also an exception—the
exception lightens and does not aggravate.”</span> An example
is furnished in the command (Exod. xxi. 12), <span class="tei tei-q">“He that smiteth
a man so that he die, he shall surely be put to death.”</span> The
exception is, <span class="tei tei-q">“Whoso killeth his neighbor ignorantly”</span> (Deut.
xix. 4, 5), <span class="tei tei-q">“he can flee to one of the cities of refuge.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(10.) <span class="tei tei-q">“When there is a general rule, and an exception not
agreeing with the general rule, the exception both lightens and
aggravates.”</span> An example is furnished from the plague of
leprosy (Lev. xiii. 3) when the hair is turned white. The head
and beard are excepted (29th verse) lest there be gray hairs—this
lightens. But if on the head and beard there be <span class="tei tei-q">“yellow
thin hair,”</span> it is a dry scall—this aggravates.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(11.) <span class="tei tei-q">“When there is an exception from a general rule to
establish a new matter—the new matter cannot be brought
under the general rule again, unless it be mentioned in the
text.”</span> An example is furnished from the eating of holy things
(Lev. xxii. 10-13). The priest, any soul bought with his
money, and he that is born in his house, may eat of it. This
is the general rule. If the priest's daughter be married to a
stranger, she may not eat of them. This is the exception. This
exception would have remained if she continued married to a
stranger, or had a child, or had not returned to her father's
house. Therefore a new law is provided, that in the event of
none of these things happening, she may again eat of the holy
things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(12.) <span class="tei tei-q">“Things that teach from the subject, and things that
teach from the end.”</span> An example is furnished from the
eighth commandment, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt not steal.”</span> This law, if
applied to man-stealing or kidnapping, implies capital punishment.
The reason given is from its following <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt
do no murder,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt not commit adultery”</span>—two
laws which, if violated, entailed death. The second part of
this rule applies to things that teach from the end. What is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
meant by the end is a matter of dispute. Some say it means
the final cause of logicians. Others say it means something
in the end or conclusion of the law itself. If it be the latter,
an example is furnished from the case of the leprous house
(Lev. xiv. 45): <span class="tei tei-q">“And he shall break down the house, the
stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the
house.”</span> These directions teach that houses made of mud are
excepted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(13.) <span class="tei tei-q">“When two texts contradict each other, until a third
be found to decide between them.”</span> An example is furnished
in Gen. i. 1: <span class="tei tei-q">“In the beginning God created the heaven and
the earth.”</span> It is again written, Gen. ii. 4, <span class="tei tei-q">“In the day that
the Lord made the earth and the heavens.”</span> The question now
arises, Which did He make first? The answer is found in
Isaiah xlviii. 13: <span class="tei tei-q">“Mine hand also hath laid the foundation
of the earth, and My right hand hath spanned the heavens.”</span>
The conclusion is drawn that He made both at once. Another
instance is the discrepancy in the census of Israel. In 2 Sam.
xxiv. 9, the number stated is eight hundred thousand. In 1
Chron. xxi. 5, the number is said to have been <span class="tei tei-q">“eleven hundred
thousand.”</span> The difference of three hundred thousand is
accounted for by referring to 1 Chron. xxvii. 1, where it is said
that twenty-four thousand served the king every month. These
men, when multiplied by the months, make two hundred and
eighty-eight thousand. And the twelve thousand which
waited upon the twelve captains raise the number to three
hundred thousand, the amount required to reconcile the two
statements.

In reading the following tracts it should be borne in mind
that the meaning in many places is more implied than expressed.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> Often an idea is taken for granted, which patient
continuance in reading can alone bring to light. The subjects
to which these tracts refer should first be studied in the Bible;
because after such study the restless subtlety of the Rabbis in
<span class="tei tei-q">“binding heavy burdens on men's shoulders”</span> can be more
fully discerned. It is desirable to look on these writings from
this point of observation; just as on some mountain top one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
looks not only at the gold which the morning sun pours on
grass and flower, but also on the deep valley where the shadows
still rest, that one may the more sensibly feel how glorious
the sun is. The whole theory of this second, or Oral Law, has
arisen from inattention to the express statement of Moses:
<span class="tei tei-q">“These words (the ten commandments) the Lord spake unto
all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of
the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: AND
HE ADDED NO MORE”</span> (Deut. v. 22). And it tends to nullify
the declaration of the Targum of Jonathan Ben Uzziel, <span class="tei tei-q">“For
unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and he has
taken the law upon himself to keep it”</span> (Isaiah ix. 6).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In concluding this introduction it is perhaps well to glance
briefly at the age in which the Talmud grew to its present
state. It was a period of great activity and thought. Old
systems of debasing superstition were breaking up and passing
away. A new faith had arisen to regenerate man. The five
centuries which followed the appearing of our Saviour in this
world were filled with religious and political events which
still make their vibrations felt. From the destruction of Jerusalem
and the overthrow of the Jewish polity, an impulse was
given to those political changes which have since gone on without
intermission among the nations of the earth. From the
overthrow of the Jewish Temple an impulse was given to religious
earnestness which, often from wrong, often from right
motives, has increased, and will increase, as the great consummation
draws nigh.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While the Rabbis were laboring at their gigantic mental
structure, while generation after generation of their wisest
and most patriotic men were accumulating materials to build
the tower which became a beacon to their countrymen for all
time, the Christian Church was not idle. By their writings
and eloquence the Fathers were gathering the treasures of
patristic lore which have descended to us. While Rabbis were
discoursing in the synagogues of Tiberias and Babylon,
Christian orators were preaching in the basilicas of Constantinople
and Rome. They have all gone from this mortal scene.
But their thoughts are handed down, so that we may converse
with them, though they are no longer on earth. We can hear
their wisdom—we can see their errors—we can almost fancy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we behold their forms—so that, being dead, they yet speak.
Since they ceased from their labors empires have risen and
fallen, countless millions of our race have vanished into eternity,
and left their bodies to moulder into dust. But their
teachings still live on, to influence immortal souls for weal or
woe. Doubtless their departures from the Word of God prepared
a way and furnished matter for the numerous heresies
and lawless deeds which form a great portion of the history of
mankind. From their errors sprang at least in part the Koran.
This and kindred themes, however, open up an interminable
vista, leading us away from the Talmud itself. It is better
now to conclude this introduction. And with what more suitable
words can I close than with those drawn from the wisdom
of the Fathers? <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not incumbent upon thee to complete
the work: neither art thou free to cease from it. If thou hast
studied the law, great shall be thy reward; for the Master of
thy work is faithful to pay the reward of thy labor: but know
that the reward of the righteous is in the world to come.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. He who sees a place where signs were wrought for Israel,
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be He who wrought signs for our fathers in
this place;”</span> a place where idolatry has been rooted out,—says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be He who hath rooted idolatry out of our
land.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. On comets, earthquakes, lightnings, thunder, and tempests,
say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be He whose strength and might fill the
world.”</span> On mountains, hills, seas, rivers, and deserts, say,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be He who made the creation.”</span> R. Judah says,
when a man sees the great sea he is to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be He
who made the great sea,”</span>—when he sees it at intervals. On
rains, and on good news say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be He who is good and
beneficent.”</span> On bad news say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be the true Judge.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. He who has built a new house, or bought new furniture,
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be He who has kept us alive,”</span> etc. One must
bless for evil the source of good; and for good the source of
evil. <span class="tei tei-q">“He who supplicates for what is past?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Such prayer
is vain.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“How?”</span> His wife is pregnant, and he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“God
grant that my wife may bring forth a male child.”</span> Such prayer
is vain. Or if one on the road hear the voice of lamentation in
the city, and say, <span class="tei tei-q">“God grant that it may not be my son, my
house,”</span> etc., such prayer is vain.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Whoever enters a fortified town must say two prayers,
one at his entrance, and one at his departure. Ben Azai says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“four, two at his entrance, and two at his departure; he returns
thanks for the past, and supplicates for the future.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. Man is bound to bless God for evil, as he is bound to
bless Him for good. For it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“And thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy might.”</span><a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“With all thy heart”</span> means, with both
thy inclinations, the evil as well as the good. <span class="tei tei-q">“With all thy
soul”</span> means, even should He deprive thee of life; and <span class="tei tei-q">“with all
thy might”</span> means with all thy wealth. Another opinion is, that
<span class="tei tei-q">“with all thy might”</span> means whatever measure He metes out
unto thee, do thou thank Him with thy entire might. No man
is to be irreverent opposite the eastern gate of the Temple,
for it is opposite the Holy of Holies. No man is to go on the
mountain of the house with his staff, shoes, or purse, nor with
dust on his feet, nor is he to make it a short cut, nor is he to
spit at all. All the seals of the blessings in the sanctuary used
to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“from eternity.”</span> But since the Epicureans perversely
taught there is but one world, it was directed that man should
say, <span class="tei tei-q">“from eternity to eternity.”</span> It was also directed that every
man should greet his friend in THE NAME, as it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“And
behold Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers,
The Lord (be) with you: and they answered him, The Lord
bless thee.”</span><a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>
And it is also said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> with thee,
thou mighty man of valor.”</span><a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> And it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Despise not thy

There is no need to say earing-time and harvest in
the Sabbatical year, but earing-time on the eve of the Sabbatical
year, when it is just entering on the Sabbatical year;
and harvest of the Sabbatical year, which is proceeding toward
the close of the Sabbatical year. Rabbi Ishmael said, <span class="tei tei-q">“as the

3. Men may remove stones till new year's day. They may
gather the ears, they may break off branches, they may cut
off the withered part till new year's day. R. Joshua said, <span class="tei tei-q">“as
they may break off branches and cut off the withered part of
the fifth year, so also they may do it in the sixth year.”</span> Rabbi

4. Men may smear the saplings, and bind them, and cut
them down, and make sheds for them, and water them, till
new year's day. R. Eleazar, the son of Zadok, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“one may
even water the top of the branch in the Sabbatical year, but
not the root.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

which is just entering on the Sabbatical year, and unripe fruit
of the Sabbatical year which is proceeding to the close of the
Sabbatical year, they may neither anoint nor puncture. Rabbi
Jehudah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“the place where it is customary to anoint them,
they may not anoint them, because that is work. The place
where it is not customary to anoint them, they may anoint
them.”</span> R. Simon <span class="tei tei-q">“permitted it in trees because it is allowable

6. Men may not plant trees, make layers, or engraft them,
on the eve of the Sabbatical year, less than thirty days before
new year's day. And if one plant them, or make layers, or
engraft them, they must be rooted out. Rabbi Judah said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“every graft which does not cohere in three days has no more
cohesion.”</span> Rabbi José and R. Simon said <span class="tei tei-q">“in two weeks.”</span>

4. <span class="tei tei-q">“He who stables his cattle in his field?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“He may make

of the time when one did not begin the work on the eve of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The Sages stated an important rule for the Sabbatical
year: <span class="tei tei-q">“Of all that is only fit for man's food a plaster may
not be made for man, and it is needless to say for beast. And
of all that is not fit for man's food a plaster may be made for
man, but not for beast.”</span> And all that is not fit either for man's
food or beast's food, if one consider it as food for man or food
for beasts, the Sages impose on it the inconveniences of the
laws relating to man and the inconveniences of the laws relating
to beast. If one, however, consider it as wood, it is
reckoned as wood; for example, the savory and the hyssop
and the laurel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Produce of the Sabbatical year is given for food, for
drink, and for anointing, to eat the thing which it is usual to
eat, and to anoint with what it is usual to anoint with. One
may not anoint with wine or vinegar. But one may anoint
with oil. And so is it likewise with the heave-offering and
second tithe. The laws of the Sabbatical year are more convenient
for them, because it is permitted to light a candle made
from them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Men must not sell the fruits of the Sabbatical year,
neither by measure, nor by weight, nor by count. Neither
may they sell figs by counting, nor greens by weight. The
school of Shammai say, <span class="tei tei-q">“nor in bunches.”</span> But the school
of Hillel say, <span class="tei tei-q">“that which it is usual to make in bunches in
the house men may make in bunches in the market; for example,
cresses and the milk-flower.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. If one said to a laborer, <span class="tei tei-q">“Here! take this aisar<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a> and

year, because men must not pay a debt with money of

5. Men must not give money of the Sabbatical year to a
well-digger, nor to a bath-keeper, nor to a barber, nor to a
skipper, but one may give it to a well-digger for drink, and
to all persons one may give a gratuitous present.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Men may not dry figs of the Sabbatical year in the usual
place, but one may dry them in a waste place. They must not
tread grapes in a wine-press, but they may tread them in a
kneading-trough. And they must not put olives into the oil-press
with the stone over them, but they may pound them and
put them into a small press. Rabbi Simon said, <span class="tei tei-q">“one may
also grind them in the house of the oil-press and put them into
the small press.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. Men must not boil greens of the Sabbatical year in oil
of the heave-offering, lest they take it for uses that are forbidden.
R. Simon <span class="tei tei-q">“allowed it.”</span> And the very last thing (in
a series of exchanges) partakes of the laws of the Sabbatical
year; but the fruit itself (first exchanged) is forbidden.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. Men must not buy servants, ground, or an unclean beast,
with money of the Sabbatical year; but if they buy them, they
must eat<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a>

an offering the two pigeons of one with an issue, or the two
pigeons after childbirth bought with money of the Sabbatical
year. And if they bring them, they must eat<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a> as much as

9. <span class="tei tei-q">“A skin which one anointed with oil of the Sabbatical
year?”</span> Rabbi Eleazar said, <span class="tei tei-q">“it must be burned.”</span> But the
Sages say, <span class="tei tei-q">“one must eat<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> as much as its value.”</span> The Sages

Eleazar said about it.”</span>

1. The rue, and the sorrel with spreading leaves, and the
wild savory, the coriander of the mountains, and the parsley
of the marshes, and the rocket of the desert, are free from
tithes; and they may be bought from all men in the Sabbatical
year, because nothing like them is legally guarded. Rabbi
Judah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“the sprouts of the mustard are allowed, because
transgressors are not suspected for taking them from a
guarded place.”</span> Rabbi Simon said, <span class="tei tei-q">“all vegetables that
sprout again are allowed, excepting the sprouts of cabbage,

2. There are three countries to be public property in the
Sabbatical year: Judah and beyond Jordan and Galilee; and
each is divided into three parts: Upper Galilee, Lower Galilee,
and the Vale. From the village of Hananiah and upward,
every part in which the sycamore tree does not grow is Upper
Galilee. And from the village of Hananiah and lower down,
where any sycamore tree grows, is Lower Galilee. And the
neighborhood of Tiberias is the Vale. And in Judah, the
mountains, the plain, and the vale, and the plain of Lydda is

King's mountain; and all countries are reckoned the same for
olives and dates.

4. Men may eat so long as there is any fruit legally free,
but they must not eat of that which is legally guarded. Rabbi
José <span class="tei tei-q">“allowed it, even when guarded.”</span> They may eat fruit
so long as it is found in birds' nests, and such fruit as is twice
produced in each year, but they must not eat of winter fruit.
R. Judah <span class="tei tei-q">“allowed it at all times, if it ripened before the summer

2. They must not light with the defiled oil of the heave-offering

4. A man must not perforate an eggshell, and fill it with
oil, and put it on the mouth of the lamp, because it drops, even

4. It happened that the men of Tiberias arranged, and introduced
a pipe of cold water into a canal of the hot springs.
The Sages said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“if it be Sabbath, it is as if hot waters

6. They must not put vessels under a lamp to catch the oil.
<span class="tei tei-q">“But if they place them, while it is still day?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“It is allowed.”</span>
But they must not use it, because it is not purposely
prepared (for Sabbath use). They may remove a new lamp,
but not an old one. Rabbi Simon says, <span class="tei tei-q">“all lamps may be removed,
except the lamp lighted for the Sabbath.”</span> They may
put a vessel under the lamp to catch sparks, but they must
not put water into it, as it quenches.

1. At first everyone who wished to (cleanse) the altar,
cleansed it. When they were many, they ran and mounted
the ascent, and each one, who at the middle outstripped his
companion by four cubits, won it. If two were equal the president
said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“lift your fingers.”</span><a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href="#note_202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">202</span></span></a>

2. It happened that two were equal, and running and
mounting the ascent, one of them thrust his companion, so
that he fell, and his leg was broken. And when the great Sanhedrin
saw that they were getting into danger, they decreed
that they should not cleanse the altar save by lot. There were
four lots, and this was the first lot.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The second lot was: Who should slay? Who sprinkle?
Who should take the ashes from the inner altar? and who
should take the ashes from the candlestick? and who should
carry the members to the ascent? the head and the right foot,
and the hind feet, the tail, and the left foot, the breast, and
the throat, and the two sides, and the inwards, and the fine
flour, and the pancakes, and the wine. Thirteen priests discharged
this lot. Said Ben Asai in the presence of R. Akiba

the things fried in the pan, and the wine.

5. And he went out to the altar which is before the LORD.
This was the golden altar. He began cleansing it, and went
down. <span class="tei tei-q">“From what place did he begin?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“From the
Northeastern corner, the Northwestern, Southwestern, and
Southeastern, the place where he began with the sin-offering
of the outer altar, at the same place he finished upon the inner
altar.”</span> R. Eliezer said, <span class="tei tei-q">“he stood in his place and cleansed,

7. All work of the day of atonement is described in order.
If the High Priest performed one before the other, he did nothing.
If the blood of the goat be sprinkled before the blood

the goat after the blood of the bullock. And if he had not
finished the performances within, the blood was spilled. He
must bring other blood, and return to sprinkle first from within.
And so in the Sanctuary, and so in the golden altar, because
all are an atonement in themselves. R. Eleazar and R.
Simon say, <span class="tei tei-q">“from the place where he stopped there he began.”</span>

caused them to be carried to the place of burning. <span class="tei tei-q">“And when

6. As they did on the week-days, so they did on the Sabbath,
save that they gathered the willow-boughs on the
Sabbath-eve, and put them into vases of gold, that they might
not fade. R. Joshua, son of Beroka, says, <span class="tei tei-q">“they brought date-branches,
and thrashed them on the ground at the sides of
the altar”</span> (others say <span class="tei tei-q">“on the altar”</span>). And the day itself

they came (with it) to the water-gate they blew the trumpet,

R. Judah says, <span class="tei tei-q">“they were of lime, but their look was dark

one wider, the other narrower, that both might get empty

there were additional offerings they blew nine times more.
On the eve of the Sabbath they again blew six times; thrice

6. <span class="tei tei-q">“How did they examine the witnesses?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The first
pair which came were examined first, and they brought in the
eldest of them, and they said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Tell us how you saw
the moon—(her horns) toward the sun, or away from the sun?
To the north, or to the south? What was her altitude?
Toward where her declination? And what was her breath?’</span>
If he said <span class="tei tei-q">‘toward the sun,’</span> he said nothing. Afterward they
brought in the second and examined; if the evidence was
found to agree, the evidence stood. The remaining pairs of
witnesses were then superficially examined, not because there
was necessity for their evidence, but not to discourage them,
that they might be willing to come again.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. The chief of the Sanhedrin said, <span class="tei tei-q">“(the feast) is sanctified”</span>;
and all the people answered after him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sanctified,
sanctified.”</span> Whether the new moon had been seen in its season,
or not, they sanctified it. R. Eleazar, son of Zadok, said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“if it were not seen in its season, they did not sanctify it, for
heaven had already sanctified it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. Rabban Gamaliel had on a tablet and on the wall of his
chamber figures and phases of the moon which he showed
to ignorant witnesses, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“was it like this you saw her,
or like that?”</span> It happened once that two witnesses came,
and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“we saw the moon in the morning in the east, and
in the evening in the west”</span>; said R. Jochanan, son of Nourri,
<span class="tei tei-q">“they are false witnesses,”</span> but when they came to Jamnia,
Rabban Gamaliel received their evidence. Two other witnesses
came, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“we saw the moon in her season, but
on the next evening of the intercalary day she was invisible,”</span>
and R. Gamaliel received them. Said R. Dosah, son of Arkenaz,
<span class="tei tei-q">“they are false witnesses, for how can they testify of a
woman being delivered, and on the morrow she is still pregnant?”</span>

came to R. Dose, son of Arkenaz. He said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“if we
are to judge the tribunal of Rabban Gamaliel, we must also
judge the tribunals which have existed from the days of Moses
till now,”</span> for it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Then went up Moses and Aaron,
Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.”</span><a id="noteref_300" name="noteref_300" href="#note_300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">300</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“And
why were not the names of the elders mentioned, but to inform
us that every three men in Israel who compose a
tribunal, are as a tribunal of Moses?”</span> R. Joshua took his
staff and money in his hand, and went to Jamnia to Rabban
Gamaliel on the day when the atonement began, according to
his reckoning. Rabban Gamaliel stood up and kissed him on
his head, saying to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“come in peace, my master and disciple—my
master in wisdom, my disciple in obeying my
words.”</span>

Jerusalem was privileged above Jamnia, because

as one. He who has said the blessings, and afterward a trumpet

they devoured them, but because the wolves were seen.”</span>

ask it thus, but rains for wells, pits, and caves.”</span> The rain
began to descend with storm. He said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I did not ask it
thus, but reasonable rain, with blessing and free-will.”</span> The
showers came down as they ought, until all Israel went up
from Jerusalem to the Mount of Olives on account of the
rains. They came and said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“as thou hast prayed that
the rains should come down, so pray that they may depart.”</span>

at the following prayer, and the offering of the wood.

6. Five things happened to our fathers on the seventeenth
of Tammuz, and five on the ninth of Ab. On the seventeenth
of Tammuz the stone tables were broken, and the daily offering
ceased, and the city was broken up, and Apostemus<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href="#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a> burnt the law, and he set up an image in the Temple. On
the ninth of Ab it was proclaimed to our fathers, that they
should not enter the land, and the House was ruined for the
first and second time, and Bither was taken, and the city was
ploughed up. On entering Ab we must diminish joy.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. The week in which the ninth of Ab comes, men are not
allowed to clip their hair, or wash their clothes; but on Thursday
they are allowed, for honor to the Sabbath. On the eve
of the ninth of Ab one must not eat from two dishes, must not
eat flesh, and must not drink wine. Rabban Simon, the son
of Gamaliel, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“one must change the style of living.”</span> R.

promenaded in white garments borrowed, that no one might
be ashamed of her poverty. All these garments must be baptized.
And the daughters of Jerusalem promenaded and

8. The remission of vows is like flying in the air, and it has
no foundation. The decisions for the Sabbath, peace-offerings,

the verse is small, but the decisions are many. Jurisprudence,
and the Temple service, cleanness and uncleanness, and illegal

7. Treading on the garments of an ordinary man defiled the
Pharisees. Treading on the garments of the Pharisees defiled

Treading on the garments of those who eat the holy flesh defiles
for the sin-offering. Joseph, the son of Joezer, was the
most pious of the priesthood, and treading on his cloak defiled

on his cloak defiled for the sin-offering.

1. There are more weighty rules for holy things, than for
the heave-offering. Because vessels may be baptized in vessels
for the heave-offering, but not for holy things. The outside
and inside and handle (are reckoned separately) for the
heave-offering, but not for holy things. He who carries that
which defiles by treading upon it, may carry the heave-offering
but not the holy flesh. Treading on the garments of those
who eat the heave-offering defiles for the holy flesh. The
measure of the holy flesh is not as the measure of the heave-offering.
Because for the holy flesh one must loose his garments
and dry himself, and baptize and afterward bind them
up. But in the heave-offering he can bind them up and afterward
baptize himself.

each renders its fellow unclean for holy things, but not
for the heave-offering.

3. Men may eat with unwashen hands the dry meat of the

4. There are weighty rules for the heave-offering, because
in Judah men are credited with the purity of wine and oil during
the whole year. And in the time of wine-pressing and oil-pressing
(men are credited) even for the heave-offering. When
the time for wine and oil pressing has passed over, and a barrel
of wine is brought for the heave-offering, it must not be received.
But one may let it stand over for the wine-pressing
next year. But if one said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I put into it a quarter log of holy

judgments on Friday or on the eve of a festival.”</span><a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390" href="#note_390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a>

2. Judgments in legal uncleanness and legal cleansings begin
with the Supreme (judge). Judgments in souls begin with
a judge at his side. All are eligible to pronounce judgments
in money matters, but all are not eligible to pronounce judgments
in souls—only priests, Levites, and Israelites who can
intermarry into the priesthood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The Sanhedrin was like half a round threshing-floor,
in order that the members might observe each other. And
two scribes of the judges stood before them—one on the right
and one on the left. And they wrote the sentence of acquittal,
and the sentence of condemnation. R. Judah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“three;
one scribe wrote the sentence of acquittal, and one wrote the
sentence of condemnation; and the third wrote both the sentence
of acquittal and the sentence of condemnation.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. And three rows of the disciples of the wise sat before
them. And each one knew his place. When it was necessary
to appoint a judge, they appointed one from the first row. One
from the second row came instead of him into the first, and
one from the third row came instead of him into the second,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and they selected another from the congregation, and they
seated him in the third row, and he did not sit in the place of
his predecessor, but he sat in a place suitable for himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. <span class="tei tei-q">“How did the judges intimidate witnesses in the testimony
for souls?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“They introduced them, and intimidated
them.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps you are speaking from guess? or from
hearsay? witness from witness? or from a trustworthy man
we heard it?”</span> Or, perhaps, <span class="tei tei-q">“you don't know that at the last
we shall proceed to inquire into your own character and investigate
it.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Have a knowledge that the judgments of
money are not as the judgments of souls. Judgments for
money, when the man pays the money he has atoned. In
judgments for souls his blood and the blood of his posterity
are suspended till the end of the world.”</span> So we find it with
Cain when he slew his brother. It is said of him,<a id="noteref_391" name="noteref_391" href="#note_391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">391</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“the voice
of thy brother's bloods crieth.”</span> He does not say thy brother's
blood, but bloods of thy brother, his blood and the blood of his
posterity. Another thing is also meant, that thy brother's
bloods are spattered on wood, and on stones. Therefore man
is created single, to teach thee that everyone who destroys one
soul from Israel, to him is the verse applicable, as if he destroys
a full world. And everyone who supports one soul in Israel,
to him is the verse applicable, as if he supports the full world.
And it is also said, for the peace of creation, that no man
may justly say to his companion, my father is greater than
thine. And that the Epicureans should not say, that there are
more Creators in the heavens, and it is also said, to show forth
the greatness of the Holy One, blessed be He! When man
stamps many coins with one stamp, all are alike. But the King
of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He! stamped every man
with the stamp of the first Adam, and no one of them is like
his companion; therefore everyone is bound to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“for my
sake was the world created.”</span> But, perhaps, the witnesses will
say <span class="tei tei-q">“what is this trouble to us?”</span> But is it not already said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“And is a witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if
he do not utter it?”</span><a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392" href="#note_392"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">392</span></span></a>
But perhaps the witnesses will say, <span class="tei tei-q">“what is it to us, to be
guilty of this man's blood?”</span> But is it not already said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“When the wicked perish, there is shouting”</span>?<a id="noteref_393" name="noteref_393" href="#note_393"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">393</span></span></a>

1. The witnesses were examined with seven investigations.
<span class="tei tei-q">“In what Sabbatical year?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“In what year?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“In what
month?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“What date in the month?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“What day?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“What

<span class="tei tei-q">“And with what did he serve?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Every judge who extends examinations is praiseworthy.
It happened that the son of Zacchai examined (even) on the
stems of figs. And what difference is there between investigations
and examinations? In investigations if one say, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
don't know,”</span> their witness is worthless. In examinations,
if one say, <span class="tei tei-q">“I don't know,”</span> and even two say, <span class="tei tei-q">“we don't
know,”</span> their witness stands. Whether in investigations or
examinations, when they contradict each other, their witness
is worthless.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. One witness said, <span class="tei tei-q">“on the second of the month,”</span> and
another witness said, <span class="tei tei-q">“the third of the month.”</span> Their witness
stands. Because one knows of the intercalary month,
and another does not know of the intercalary month. One
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“on the third,”</span> and another said, <span class="tei tei-q">“on the fifth”</span>; their
witness is worthless. One said, <span class="tei tei-q">“at the second hour,”</span> and
another said, <span class="tei tei-q">“at the third hour”</span>; their witness stands. One
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“at the third,”</span> and another said, <span class="tei tei-q">“at the fifth”</span>; their
witness is worthless. R. Judah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“it stands.”</span> One said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“on the fifth,”</span> and another said, <span class="tei tei-q">“on the seventh”</span>; their
witness is worthless, because at the fifth (hour) the sun is in
the east, and at the seventh hour the sun is in the west.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. And afterward they introduce the second (witness) and
examine him. If both their statements agree, they open the
case with clearing. One of the witnesses says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I possess information
to clear him.”</span> Or one of the disciples of the Sanhedrin
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I possess information for condemning.”</span> They
order him to keep silence. One of the disciples of the Sanhedrin
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I possess information to clear him.”</span> They
bring him up, and seat him between the judges, and he did not
go down during the whole day. If there be substantial information,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they give him a hearing. And even when he (the
accused) says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I possess information for clearing myself,”</span>
the judges give him a hearing; only there must be substantial
information in his words.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. If the judges found him clear, they released him, but
if not they deferred his judgment till the morrow. They conversed
in pairs, and reduced their eating, and they drank no
wine all the day, and discussed the matter the whole night.
And on the morrow they came very early to the judgment
hall. He who was for clearing said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I was for clearing, and
I am for clearing in my place.”</span> And he who was for condemning
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I was for condemning, and I am for condemning
in my place.”</span> He who pronounced for condemning, could
pronounce for clearing, but he who pronounced for clearing,
could not turn round and pronounce for condemning. If the
judges erred in a matter, the two scribes of the judges recalled
it to their memory. If they found him clear, they released him:
but if not, they stood to be counted. <span class="tei tei-q">“Twelve cleared him,
and eleven condemned?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“He is clear.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Twelve condemned
him, and eleven cleared him, and even eleven cleared,
and eleven condemned,”</span> and one said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I don't know.”</span> And
even twenty-two cleared or condemned, and one said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I don't
know?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“They must add judges.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“How many do they
add as judges two by two?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Up to seventy-one.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Thirty-six
cleared him, and thirty-five condemned him?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“He is
clear.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Thirty-six condemned him, and thirty-five cleared
him?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“They disputed with each other until one of the condemning
party acknowledged the statement of the clearing
party.”</span>

to stone him.<a id="noteref_394" name="noteref_394" href="#note_394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">394</span></span></a>

One stood at the door of the judgment-hall with towels in his
hand, and another man rode a horse at a distance from him,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but so that he might see him. If one said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have something
to tell for clearing,”</span> this one waved the towels, and the other
galloped his horse, and stopped the accused. And even though
he himself said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have something to tell to clear myself,”</span> they
brought him back as many as four or five times, only there
must be substance in his words. If they found him clear, they
freed him; but if not, they took him forth to stone him. And
a herald preceded him (crying), <span class="tei tei-q">“Such a one, the son of such
a one, is brought out for stoning, because he committed such
a transgression, and so and so are witnesses; let everyone
who knows aught for clearing him come forth and tell it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. When he was ten cubits from the place of stoning, they
said to him <span class="tei tei-q">“confess,”</span> as it is the custom of all about to die to
confess, since to everyone who confesses there is a portion in
the world to come. So we find with Achan when Joshua said
to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of
Israel, and make confession unto him.”</span><a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396" href="#note_396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">396</span></span></a> And Achan answered
Joshua, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Indeed, I have sinned against the
Lord God of Israel, and thus and thus I have done.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“And
from whence know we that his confession made atonement for
him?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“As it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘And Joshua said, Why hast thou
troubled us? the Lord shall trouble thee this day. This day
thou art troubled, but thou shalt not be troubled in the world
to come.’</span> ”</span> And if he did not know how to confess, they told
him to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“let my death be an atonement for all my sins.”</span>
Rabbi Judah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“if he knew that he was falsely condemned,
he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘let my death be an atonement for all my sins, except
this one’</span>;”</span> the (Sages) said, <span class="tei tei-q">“if so, every man will speak thus
to make themselves innocent.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. When he was four cubits from the place of stoning, they
stripped off his garments. <span class="tei tei-q">“If a man, they covered him in
front; if a woman, before and behind.”</span> The words of Rabbi
Judah. But the Sages say <span class="tei tei-q">“a man was stoned naked, but the
woman was not stoned naked.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The place of stoning was two men high. One of the witnesses
thrust him down on his loins. If he turned on his heart,
the witness must turn him on his loins. If he died with that
thrust it was finished; but if not, the second (witness) took the
stone, and cast it upon his heart. If he died with that blow, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stoning was finished. But if not, he was stoned by all Israel,
as is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him
to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the
people.”</span><a id="noteref_397" name="noteref_397" href="#note_397"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">397</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“All who were stoned were hung up.”</span> The words of Rabbi
Eliezer. But the Sages say, <span class="tei tei-q">“none were hung up, save the
blasphemer and the idolater.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The man is to be hung with
his face toward the people, but the woman with her face toward
the wood.”</span> The words of Rabbi Eliezer. But the Sages
say, <span class="tei tei-q">“the man was hung up, but they do not hang up a
woman.”</span> Rabbi Eleazar said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“and did not Simon,
the son of Shatach, hang women in Askalon?”</span> They said
to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“he hung up eighty women (witches), and two could
not be judged, in one day.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“How did they hang him?”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“They sunk a beam in the ground, and a traverse beam proceeded
from it, and they bound his hands, one over the other,
and hung him up”</span> (by them). R. José said, <span class="tei tei-q">“the beam was
inclined against the wall, and he was hung upon it, just as the
butchers do.”</span> And they loosed him immediately afterward.
<span class="tei tei-q">“But if he was out all night?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“It was a transgression of
a negative command, as is said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘His body shall not remain all
night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that
day (for he that is hanged is accursed of God),’</span> ”</span><a id="noteref_398" name="noteref_398" href="#note_398"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">398</span></span></a> etc. As one says, <span class="tei tei-q">“wherefore is this one hung?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Because he
blasphemed the NAME, and it follows that the heavenly NAME
is profaned.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. Rabbi Meier said, <span class="tei tei-q">“when man is sorrowful,<a id="noteref_399" name="noteref_399" href="#note_399"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">399</span></span></a> what language does the
Shekinah<a id="noteref_400" name="noteref_400" href="#note_400"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">400</span></span></a> make him to utter?”</span> If it be
lawful so to speak, <span class="tei tei-q">“my head makes me ashamed, my arm
makes me ashamed.”</span> If, to speak after the manner of men,
OMNIPRESENCE is sorrowful, when the blood of the wicked
is poured out, how much more sorrowful is He for the blood of
the righteous? And not in the case of the condemned alone,
but everyone who leaves his dead overnight, is a transgressor
of a negative command. If they left him for the sake of
honor, to bring a coffin and a shroud for him, there is no transgression.
But they did not bury him (the condemned) in the
sepulchres of his fathers. And there were two burial grounds
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
prepared for the Judgment Hall—one for the stoned and the
burned, and one for those beheaded and strangled.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. When the flesh of the condemned was consumed, they
gathered his bones and buried them in their proper place; and
his relatives came and asked after the peace of the judges, and
the peace of the witnesses, as much as to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“know there is
nothing in our hearts against you, as your judgment was
true.”</span> And they did not mourn, but were gloomy, since gloominess
is only in the heart.

1. Four punishments were permitted to the supreme court—stoning,
burning, beheading, and strangling. R. Simon
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“burning, stoning, strangling, and beheading.”</span> The
preceding chapter is the order of stoning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The order for those burned was to be sunk in dung to
their knees. And men put a hard towel in a soft one, and encircled
his neck. One pulled on one side, and another pulled
on the other side, till the condemned opened his mouth. And
one lit a wick, and cast it into his mouth, and it went down to
his bowels, and it consumed his intestines. R. Judah said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“if he died in their hands, they did not complete in him the
order of burning; only they opened his mouth with tongs
against his will, and lit the wick, and cast it into his mouth,
and it went down to his bowels and consumed his intestines.”</span>
Said R. Eleazar the son of Zadok, <span class="tei tei-q">“it happened with the
daughter of a priest, who was immoral, that they surrounded
her with dry branches and burned her.”</span> The Sages replied,
<span class="tei tei-q">“because the court at that time was unskilled.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The order of those beheaded was to have their heads
struck off with a sword, as is the custom of governments.
R. Judah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“that was an abuse; they only rested his head
on a block, and hewed it off with an axe.”</span> The Sages replied
to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“no death is a greater abuse than that.”</span> The order
for those strangled was, that they were sunk down in dung to
their knees, and they put a hard towel inside a soft one, and encircled
his neck. One pulled on one side, and another pulled
on the other side, till his soul departed.

5. The blasphemer was not guilty till he expressed the
NAME. Said R. Joshua, the son of Korcha, every day they
examined the witnesses under a substituted (feigned) name,
for example, <span class="tei tei-q">“José shall beat José.”</span> When the judgment was
finished, they could not execute him under the nickname, but
they withdrew all men outside, and interrogated the principal
witness, and said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“tell us clearly what thou hast
heard?”</span> and he said it. And the judges stood up on their
feet, and rent their garments,<a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href="#note_402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">402</span></span></a> and they were never sewn

6. One committed idolatry, whether he served the idol, or
sacrificed to it, or burned incense to it, or made a libation to it,
or bowed down to it, or accepted it for his god. And also, he
who said to it, <span class="tei tei-q">“thou art my God.”</span> But he who embraced it,
and kissed it, and honored it, and dusted it, and washed it, and
anointed it, and dressed it, and put shoes on it, transgressed
a negative command. He who vowed in its name, and performed
the vow in its name, transgressed a negative command.

4. The men of a city withdrawn to idolatry have no portion

withdrawers be men. If the withdrawers be women, or children,
or the minority be withdrawn, or the withdrawers be
outside it, they are to be treated singly, and they need two
witnesses, and a warning to each one of them. It is more
grievous for individuals than for the multitude, because individuals
must be stoned, though for that reason their money
is safe for their heirs; but the multitude are cut off with the
sword, and for that reason their money is lost.

1. These are to be strangled—he who beats his father or
his mother, and he who steals a soul from Israel, and an
<span class="tei tei-q">“elder”</span> who is rebellious against the judges, and a false
prophet, and he who prophesies in the name of idolatry, and
false witnesses proved to be perjured against a priest's daughter
and her paramour. He who beats father or mother is not
guilty till he make a bruise in them. It is more grievous to
curse them than to beat them. Because if he cursed them
after their death, he is guilty; but if he beat them after their
death, he is free. He who stole a soul from Israel is not guilty
till he bring him on his property. R. Judah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“till he
bring him on his property and obtain service by him,”</span> as is
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“And maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him.”</span><a id="noteref_431" name="noteref_431" href="#note_431"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">431</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“If he steal his own son?”</span> R.

the sages pronounce him <span class="tei tei-q">“free.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“If he stole one, half a
servant and half free?”</span> R. Judah pronounces him <span class="tei tei-q">“guilty,”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The elder rebellious against the decision of the judges?
as it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“If there arise a matter too hard for thee in
judgment,”</span><a id="noteref_432" name="noteref_432" href="#note_432"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">432</span></span></a> etc. There were three places of
judgment. One place was by the door of the Mountain of the House; and
one was by the door of the court; and one was in the chamber
of hewn stone. The witnesses against the rebellious elder
came to the one by the door of the Mountain of the House,
and each one said, <span class="tei tei-q">“so I expounded, and so my companions
expounded; so I taught, and so my companions taught.”</span> If
the judges listened to them, they told them: but if not, they
went to those at the door of the court, and each one said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“so I expounded, and so my companions expounded; so I
taught, and so my companions taught.”</span> If they listened to
them, they told them; but if not, both parties went to the supreme
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
court in the chamber of hewn stone, because from it
the Law proceeded forth to all Israel, as is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Of that
place which the Lord shall choose.”</span><a id="noteref_433" name="noteref_433" href="#note_433"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">433</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“If
the rebellious elder returned to his city, and taught as before?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“He is free.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“But if he decided to practise false teaching?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“He is
guilty,”</span> as is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“And the man that will do
presumptuously.”</span><a id="noteref_434" name="noteref_434" href="#note_434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">434</span></span></a> He is not guilty till he
decide to practise his false teaching. A disciple who decided to practise false teaching
is free. It follows that what is a grave offence in the one is a
light offence in the other.

3. The burden in the words of the scribes is greater than
the burden in the words of the law. He who said, <span class="tei tei-q">“There are

<span class="tei tei-q">“He is free.”</span> He who said, <span class="tei tei-q">“There are five frontlets, so as

such a man, is condemned to death by the tribunal.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. A false prophet, who prophesied what he did not hear,
and what was not told to him, is put to death by the hands of
man. But he who suppressed his prophecy, and he who added
to the words of a prophet, and a prophet who transgressed his
own words, is put to death by the visitation of heaven, as is
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will require it of him.”</span><a id="noteref_437" name="noteref_437" href="#note_437"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">437</span></span></a>

6. And he who prophesied in the name of idolatry and
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“so the idol said,”</span> even though its decision was exactly
to pronounce unclean the unclean, and to pronounce cleansed
the clean, is to be strangled. And so also the false witnesses
against a priest's daughter. Because all false witnesses are
condemned to the same death which they had intended (for
the accused), except false witnesses against the daughter of a
priest, and they are to be strangled.

1. Three days before the feasts of the idolaters it is forbidden
to deal with them, to lend articles to them, or to take
a loan of articles from them; to make a loan of money to them,
or to borrow money from them; to repay them, or to take payment
from them. Rabbi Judah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is allowed to take
payment from them, since it is unsatisfactory to the idolater.”</span>
The (Sages) answered him, <span class="tei tei-q">“though it is unpleasant to him
now, he rejoices afterward.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. R. Ishmael said, <span class="tei tei-q">“three days before and three days after

feasts it is forbidden, after their feasts it is allowed.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. <span class="tei tei-q">“And these are the feasts of the idolaters—the Kalends,
and the Saturnalia, and the Quartesima, and the coronation
day of their kings, and the day of their birth, and the day of
their death.”</span> The words of R. Meier. But the Sages say,
<span class="tei tei-q">“every death anniversary in which there is burning of incense,<a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href="#note_439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a> there is in it the worship of idols.

idolatry be outside?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Inside it is allowed.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“How is it

6. These things are forbidden to be sold to idolaters—fir-cones,
and the best figs, with their clusters, and incense, and
the white cock. R. Judah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is allowable to sell a white
cock among many others. But when a man has only one, he
must cut its claw before he sell it, since the heathen do not
offer that which is blemished in idol worship.”</span> And all other
things for ordinary uses are allowed—but if they be declared
to be for idolatry, they are forbidden. R. Meier said, <span class="tei tei-q">“even
the fine dates, and the date sap,<a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href="#note_440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a> and the

7. Where they are accustomed to sell small cattle to
idolaters, they may sell them. Where they are unaccustomed
to sell them, they must not sell them. And everywhere they
must not sell to them the large cattle, calves, ass foals, unblemished
or blemished. R. Judah allowed the broken-boned;
and Benbethira allowed even horses.

8. Men must not sell to them bears or lions, or anything

it is forbidden to build farther.

9. And Israelites must not make decorations for idols, necklaces,
and nose-rings, and rings. R. Eleazar said, <span class="tei tei-q">“for pay it
is allowed.”</span> Men must not sell to them what is fastened to
the ground. But one may sell it after it is cut down. R. Judah
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

10. <span class="tei tei-q">“Men must not let to them buildings<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444" href="#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">444</span></span></a> in the
Land of Israel, and it is needless to say fields. But in Syria they may
let to them buildings, but not fields. But out of the Land
they may sell to them buildings, and may rent to them fields.”</span>
The words of R. Meier. R. José said, <span class="tei tei-q">“in the Land of Israel
men may let to them buildings, but not fields. But in Syria
they may sell buildings and rent fields to them, and out of the
Land they may sell both.”</span> However, where they said to let,
they did not say a dwelling-house; since a heathen can bring
inside of it an idol, as it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt not bring in
abomination into thy house.”</span><a id="noteref_445" name="noteref_445" href="#note_445"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">445</span></span></a> And everywhere a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. A daughter of Israel must not attend an idolatrous

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Moses received the Oral Law from Sinai and delivered
it to Joshua, and Joshua delivered it to the elders, and the
elders to the prophets, and the prophets to the men of the
great synagogue.<a id="noteref_467" name="noteref_467" href="#note_467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">467</span></span></a> They said three things, <span class="tei tei-q">“be deliberate in
judgment, raise up many disciples, and make a fence for the
law.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Simon the Just was one of the last of the men of the
great synagogue. He used to say that the world stood on
three things—<span class="tei tei-q">“on the law, the service, and the acts of the
pious.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Antigonus of Soco received (the law) from Simon the
Just. He used to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“be not as servants, who serve their
master for the sake of receiving a reward, but be like servants
who serve their master without the view of receiving a reward;
and let the fear of heaven be upon you.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. José, son of Joezer of Zeredah, and José, son of Jochanan
of Jerusalem, received (the oral law) from him. José, son of
Joezer of Zeredah, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“let thy house be a house of assembly
for the wise, and dust thyself with the dust of their feet, and
drink their words in thirstiness.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. José, son of Jochanan of Jerusalem, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“let thy house
be wide open, and let the poor be thy children. Discourse
not much with women, not even with thy wife, much less with

thy neighbor's wife.”</span> Hence the wise men say, <span class="tei tei-q">“whoever
converses much with women brings evil on himself, neglects
the study of the law, and at last will inherit hell.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Joshua, son of Perechiah, and Natai the Arbelite received
the oral law from them. Joshua, son of Perechiah, said,

mankind with favor.”</span>

to escape punishment.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. Judah, son of Tabai, and Simon, son of Shetach, received
it of them. Judah, son of Tabai, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“consider not thyself
as the arranger of the law, and when the parties are before
thee in judgment, consider them as guilty; but when they are
departed from thee, consider them as innocent, when they
have acquiesced in the sentence.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. Simon, son of Shetach, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“be extremely careful in

11. Abtalyon said, <span class="tei tei-q">“ye Sages, be cautious of your words,

of them, by which means the name of God may be profaned.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
12. Hillel and Shammai received it of them. Hillel said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“be thou of the disciples of Aaron, who loved peace, and pursued
peace, so that thou love mankind, and allure them to the
study of the law.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
13. He used to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“whoever aggrandizes his name, destroys
his name, and he who does not increase his knowledge
in the law, shall be cut off, and he who does not study the law,
is deserving of death, and he who serves himself with the
crown of the law, will perish.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
14. He also said, <span class="tei tei-q">“if I perform not good works myself, who
can do them for me?”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“when I consider myself, what am
I?”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“if not now, when shall I?”</span>

and do much, and receive all men with an open, pleasant
face.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
16. Rabban Gamaliel said, <span class="tei tei-q">“procure thyself an instructor,
that thou mayest not be in doubt, and accustom not thyself to
give tithes by conjecture.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
17. Simon, his son, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have all my life been brought
up among wise men, and never found anything so good for the
body as silence, neither is the study of the law the principal
thing, but its practice,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“whoever multiplies words causes
sin.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
18. Rabban Simon, son of Gamaliel, said the duration of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Rabbi Judah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“which are the most eligible paths
for man to choose? All such as are an ornament to those who
tread therein; and get them honor from man. Be also as careful
of the observance of a light precept, as of a weighty one;
because thou knowest not the due reward of the precepts, and
balance the loss sustained by the omission of a precept against
its recompense, and the reward of sin against its loss of happiness.
Consider also three things, and thou wilt not transgress.
Understand what is above thee: an All-seeing Eye
and a Hearing Ear; and that all thy actions are written in a
Book.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Rabban Gamaliel, the son of Rabban Judah the Prince,
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the study of the law and intercourse with the world
are commendable together, as the joining of these two annihilates
sin; and all the study of the law, that is not supported
by business, will become of none effect, and will be the cause
of sin; and whoever is engaged in the service of the congregation,
ought to act for God's sake, then will the merit of their
ancestors support them, and their charitable deeds exist to
eternity; and I (God) shall account you deserving of a great
recompense, as if ye had actually done it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. <span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye warned of following princes, as they only bestow
favors on men for their own interest. They show themselves
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as friends while men are useful to them; but they will not support
a man in time of need.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. He used to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“do His will as if it were thine own
will, that He may accomplish thy will as if it were His will;
abolish thy will for the sake of His will, that He may abolish
the will of others for the sake of thy will.”</span> Hillel said, <span class="tei tei-q">“separate
not thyself from the congregation, nor have confidence
in thyself, until the day of thy death. Judge not thy neighbor
till thou art in his situation, neither utter a sentence as
if it were incomprehensible, that afterward may be comprehended,
nor say, when I shall have leisure I shall study;
mayhap thou wilt not have leisure.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. He also said, <span class="tei tei-q">“a boor cannot be fearful of sin, nor can a
rustic be a saint; the bashful will not become learned, nor the
passionate man a teacher; neither will he, who is much engaged
in traffic, become wise; and where there are no men,
strive thou to be a man.”</span>

robbery; but he who increases his knowledge of the law, increases
life; he who increases his study in college, increases
wisdom; he who increases counsel, increases prudence; he
who increases justice, increases peace; if a man have gained
a good name, he has gained it for himself; if he have gained
the words of the law, he has gained for himself everlasting life

8. Rabbi Jochanan, son of Zaccai, received the oral law

spent much time in the study of the law, yet pride not thyself

son of Zaccai, had five disciples, and these are they: Rabbi
Eleazar, son of Hyrcanus, Rabbi Joshua, son of Chananya,
Rabbi José the priest, Rabbi Simon, son of Nathanael, Rabbi
Eleazar, son of Arach. He used thus to estimate their merits:

used to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“if all the Sages of Israel were in one scale of

9. He also said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“go forth and consider which is

R. José said, <span class="tei tei-q">“a good neighbor.”</span> R. Simon said, <span class="tei tei-q">“he

He then said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“I prefer the words of R. Eleazar, son

10. They also said three things. R. Eleazar said, <span class="tei tei-q">“let the
honor of thy companion be as dear to thee as thine own; and
be not easily moved to anger; and repent one day before thy
death; and warm thyself by the fire of the Sages, and be careful
that their coal does not burn thee, for their bite is as a bite
of a fox, and their sting is as the sting of a scorpion, and their
burn is the burn of a fiery serpent, and all their words are as
fiery coals.”</span>

Know also that everything is done according to the account,

formed, and against thy will wast thou born, and against thy

1. The Priests guarded the sanctuary in three places<a id="noteref_534" name="noteref_534" href="#note_534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">534</span></span></a>—in
the House Abtinas, in the House Nitzus, and in the House
Moked. The House Abtinas and the House Nitzus had
upper chambers, and the young priests guarded there. The
House Moked was arched, and its large chamber was surrounded
with stone divans, and the elders of the House of
the Fathers slept there, with the keys of the court in their
hands; and the younger priests also slept there, each with
his cushion on the ground. They did not sleep in the holy
garments, but they undressed, and folded them, and put
them under their heads, and they covered themselves with
their own dresses. If legal defilement happened to one of
them, he went out, and proceeded in the circuit that went
under the Temple, and candles flamed on either side, until he
arrived in the house of baptism. And the fire pile was there,
and the place of the seat of honor; and this was its honor,
when he found it closed, he knew that someone was there;
when he found it open he knew that no one was there. He
descended and washed; he came up and wiped himself, and
warmed himself before the fire pile. He came and sat beside
his brethren the priests, till the doors were opened; then he
went out on his own way.

2. He who wished to take the ashes from the altar, rose
up early and bathed before the Captain of the Temple came.
And in what hour did the Captain come? All times were
not equal; sometimes he came at cockcrow, or near to it, before
or after it. The Captain came, and knocked for them,
and they opened to him. He said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“let whoever is
washed, come, and cast lots.”</span> They cast lots, and he gained
who gained.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. He took the key and opened the wicket door, and entered
from the House Moked to the court, and the priests
went after him with two lighted torches in their hands. And
they divided themselves into two parties. These went in the
gallery eastward, and those went in the gallery westward.
They observed everything as they walked till they approached
the place of the pancake-makers. They arrived. Both parties
said, peace! all peace! The pancake-makers began to
make pancakes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. He who gained the lot to take the ashes from the altar,
took them; and they said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“be careful that thou touch
not the vessels, till thou dost sanctify thy hands and thy feet
from the laver.”</span> And the ash dish was placed in the corner
between the ascent to the altar and the west of the ascent.
No man entered with the priest, and there was no candle in
his hand, but he walked toward the light of the fire on the
altar. They did not see him, and they did not hear his voice,
till they heard the creaking of the wheel, which the son of
Kattin made for the laver, and they said, <span class="tei tei-q">“the time has come
to sanctify his hands and feet from the laver.”</span> He took the
silver ash dish, and he went up to the top of the altar, and he
turned the live coals on one side, and he piled up those that
were well burned inward, and he descended, and came on the
pavement of the altar. He turned his face northward, and
went eastward of the ascent about ten cubits. He packed the
coals on the pavement three hand-breadths distant from the
ascent, at the place where they put the crops of the fowls, and
the ashes of the inner altar, and of the candlestick.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. His brethren saw him come down, and they came running
to him. They hastened and sanctified their hands and
their feet from the laver. They took the brushes and the forks,
and went up to the top of the altar. The members and the
cauls<a id="noteref_535" name="noteref_535" href="#note_535"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">535</span></span></a> (of the sacrifices) which were not
consumed over night, they moved to the side of the altar. If the sides could not
contain them, they laid them out in a closet at the ascent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. They commenced to bring up the ashes to the top of
the heap,<a id="noteref_536" name="noteref_536" href="#note_536"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">536</span></span></a> and the heap was on the

did not clear away the ashes, since they were an honor for the
altar. Never was the priest lazy in removing the ashes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The priests began bringing up the fagots to arrange
the fire of preparation on the altar. <span class="tei tei-q">“Was, then, all wood
allowed for preparation?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, all wood was allowed for
the fire of preparation, except that of the olive and that of
the vine. But these they preferred—branches of the fig-tree,
of the nut, and of the pine.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The priests arranged the great fire of preparation eastward,
and then made an opening eastward, so that the heads
of the inward fagots touched the heap on the altar. And
there was a division between the fagots, that the priests might
kindle the chips there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. The priest chose from the fagots the best figwood to
arrange the second fire of preparation for the incense opposite
the western horn southward. He prolonged it from the horn
toward the north four cubits, reckoning for five seahs<a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538" href="#note_538"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">538</span></span></a> of live
coals, and on the Sabbath he reckoned for eight seahs of live
coals. As they placed there the two cups of frankincense of
the showbread. The members and cauls (of the sacrifices)
which were not consumed by the fire overnight, were returned
again by the priests to the great fire of preparation. And they
kindled both the preparations with fire; and they came down,
and entered into the chamber of hewn stone.<a id="noteref_539" name="noteref_539" href="#note_539"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">539</span></span></a>

foot, and the two hind feet, the chine, and the left foot, the

and he gained who gained.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The Captain said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“go and see if the time for
slaughter approaches?”</span> If it approached, the watchman said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“it brightens.”</span> Matthia, son of Samuel, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“is it light in
the whole east, even to Hebron?”</span> and he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“yes.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. He said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“go and bring the lamb from the lamb-chamber.”</span>
The lamb-chamber was in the northwest corner
of the court, and there were four chambers there, one the
lamb-chamber, one the seal-chamber,<a id="noteref_540" name="noteref_540" href="#note_540"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">540</span></span></a> and one chamber for
the burning materials, and one chamber where they made
showbread.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The priests entered the chamber for the vessels, and they
brought out ninety-three vessels of silver and gold. They
made the daily sacrifice drink in a golden cup. Even though
he was examined the night before, they examined him again
by torch-light.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. He who gained the lot for the daily sacrifice, led the
lamb to the slaughter-house, and those who gained the lots
for the members, went after him. The slaughter-house was
to the north of the altar, and in it were eight dwarf pillars,
and beams of cedar-wood were fastened upon them, and iron
hooks were fastened in them. And there were three rows
of hooks to each of them. Upon them the priests hung the
sacrifices, and skinned them, near the marble tables between
the pillars.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Those who gained the lot for the removal of the ashes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the inner altar, and the ashes from the candlestick, advanced
with four vessels in their hands, a flagon<a id="noteref_541" name="noteref_541" href="#note_541"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">541</span></span></a> and a cup<a id="noteref_542" name="noteref_542" href="#note_542"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">542</span></span></a>

containing two cabs and a half. And the cup resembled a
great golden jug. And the two keys to the sanctuary. One
key entered the lock up to the shoulder of the priest, and one
opened quickly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. The priest came to the wicket on the north, and there
were two wickets in the great gate, one in the north and one
in the south. Through that in the south man never entered,
and Ezekiel explains it. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then said the Lord unto me: This
gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall
enter in by it; because the Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered
in by it, therefore it shall be shut.”</span><a id="noteref_543" name="noteref_543" href="#note_543"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">543</span></span></a> He took
the key and opened the wicket; he entered the chamber, and he went
from the chamber into the sanctuary, until he came to the
great gate. When he came to the great gate, he took down
the bar and the bolts and opened it. The slaughterer did not
slaughter till he heard the noise of the opening of the great
gate.

From Jericho they heard the noise of the wooden wheel which
the son of Kattin made for the laver. From Jericho they
heard the voice of Gabini the herald. From Jericho they heard
the sound of the cornet. From Jericho they heard the sound
of the cymbal. From Jericho they heard the voice of the song.
From Jericho they heard the clang of the horn, and some
say even the voice of the High Priest at the time when he mentioned
the Name on the Day of Atonement. From Jericho
they smelled the odor of the preparation of incense. Said R.
Eleazar, the son of Daglai, <span class="tei tei-q">“the family of Aba had goats on
the mountains of Mikvor,<a id="noteref_546" name="noteref_546" href="#note_546"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">546</span></span></a> and they used to
sneeze from the odor of the preparation of the incense.”</span>

before him, and he took handfuls of ashes and filled them
into the flagon, and at last he brushed the remainder into it.
And he left it and went out (of the holy place). He who
gained the lot for removing the snuff from the candlestick,
entered and found the two eastern lights burning. He snuffed
the rest, and left these burning in their place. If he found
them extinguished, he snuffed them, and lighted them again
from those still burning, and afterward he snuffed the rest.
And there was a stone before the candlestick, and in it were
three steps, on which the priest stood and trimmed the lights.
And he placed the cup with the snuff on the second step, and
went out.

but they bound its fore and hind feet. He who gained the

its head southward, and its face westward. The slaughterer
stood in the east with his face westward. The morning sacrifice
was slaughtered at the northwestern corner on the second
ring. The evening sacrifice was slaughtered at the northeastern
corner on the second ring. The slaughterer slaughtered,
and the receiver caught (the blood). The priest came
to the northeastern corner of the altar, and he sprinkled the
blood northeast. He came to the southwest, and sprinkled
the blood southwest:<a id="noteref_547" name="noteref_547" href="#note_547"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">547</span></span></a> the remainder

it downward till he came to the breast. When he came to the
breast, he cut off the head, and gave it to him who had gained
(its lot). He cut off the two hind feet, and gave them to him
who had gained them for his lot. He finished the skinning;
he tore out the heart, that the blood should come out. He
cut off the two fore feet, and gave them to him who had gained
them for his lot. He came to the right leg; he cut it off, and
gave it to him who had gained it for his lot. He cleft the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
body, and it became all open before him. He took out the
caul, and put it on the place of slaughter, with the head on
the top of it. He took out the intestines and gave them to
him who had gained them for his lot to cleanse them. And
the belly they cleansed in the house of the washers, as much
as was needful. And the intestines were cleansed three times
at least, upon the marble tables between the pillars.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The priest took the knife and separated the lungs from
the liver, and the finger of the liver from the liver, but he did
not remove it from its place. He made a hole in the breast,
and gave it to him who gained it for his lot. He came to the
right side, and he cut it downward to the backbone, but he
did not touch the backbone, till he came to the two tender
ribs. He cut it off and gave it to him who gained it for his
lot, with the liver hanging upon it. He came to the neck,
and left the two side bones on both sides. He cut it off and
gave it to him who had gained it for his lot, with the windpipe
and the heart and the lungs hanging upon it. He came to
the left side, and left on it the two tender ribs, above and below,
and so he left it on the corresponding side. It follows that
he left on the two sides, two and two ribs above, and two and
two ribs below. He cut it off, and gave it to him who gained
it for his lot, the backbone with it, and the spleen hanging
upon it. And it was large, but the right side is called large,
as the liver hangs upon it. He came to the tail; he cut it off
and gave it to him who gained it for his lot, and the fat, and
the finger of the liver, and the two kidneys with it. He took
the left hind leg, and gave it to him who gained it for his lot.
It follows that all the priests stood in one row with the members
in their hands. The first priest with the head and hind
foot, the head in his right hand with the nose toward his arm,
and the horns between his fingers, and the place of slaughter
upward, and the caul placed on it; and the right hind foot
in his left hand with the skin outside. The second priest
stood with the two fore legs, the right in his right hand, and
the left in his left hand, and the skin outside. The third priest
stood with the tail and the hind foot; the tail in his right hand,
and the fat wrapped between his fingers, and the finger of the
liver and the two kidneys with it; the left foot was in his left
hand with the skin outward. The fourth priest stood with the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
breast and the throat. The breast was in his right hand, and
the throat in his left, and its side bones between his fingers.
The fifth priest stood with the two sides, the right side in his
right hand, and the left side in his left hand, and the skinny
side outward. The sixth priest stood with the intestines placed
in a pan, and the legs over them. The seventh priest stood
with the fine flour. The eighth priest stood with the pancakes.
The ninth priest stood with the wine. They then proceeded
and deposited the members on the lower half of the
ascent westward, and they salted them, and descended, and
came to the chamber of the hewn stone to read the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hear,”</span><a id="noteref_548" name="noteref_548" href="#note_548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">548</span></span></a>

1. The Captain of the Watch said, <span class="tei tei-q">“give one blessing,”</span>

Service,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“the Blessing of the Priests.”</span> And on the Sabbath
they added one blessing for the outgoing Temple-guard.

2. He said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“novices<a id="noteref_552" name="noteref_552" href="#note_552"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a> to the incense,

to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“novices with old men come and cast lots, who shall
bring up the members of the lamb from the ascent to the

brought the members to the ascent must also bring them to
the top of the altar.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. He handed the priests over to the sextons. They divested
them of their dresses, leaving them their breeches only,
and there were windows there, and over them was written,
<span class="tei tei-q">“used for vestments.”</span><a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553" href="#note_553"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">553</span></span></a>

three cabs. And the pan was heaped full of incense; and it
had a covering like a kind of weight upon it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. He who gained the lot for the censer, took the silver
censer, and went up to the top of the altar, and he turned the
live coals here and there, and he put them into the censer.
He descended, and poured them into a censer of gold. There
was dispersed from them about a cab of live coals, and he
brushed them into the channel for refuse. On the Sabbath
he put over them a cover. And the cover was a great vessel
containing a letech.<a id="noteref_554" name="noteref_554" href="#note_554"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">554</span></span></a>
And there were two chains to it, one
by which the priest drew it down, and one by which he held
it from above, that it should not be rolled about; and it was
useful for three purposes, as a covering over the live coals,
and as a covering over the reptile on the Sabbath, and it was
also used to carry down the ashes from the altar.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. The priests arrived between the porch and the altar. One
of them took the shovel,<a id="noteref_555" name="noteref_555" href="#note_555"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">555</span></span></a>
and flung it between the porch and
the altar. No one could hear the voice of his neighbor in
Jerusalem from the rattling of the shovel. And it was useful
for three purposes: when the priest heard its rattle, he knew
that his brother priests were entering to worship, and he came
running; and the Levite, when he heard its rattle, knew that
his brother Levites were entering to chant, and he came running;
and the chief of the Delegates<a id="noteref_556" name="noteref_556" href="#note_556"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">556</span></span></a>

1. The priests began ascending the steps of the porch. They
who gained the lot for the removal of ashes from the inner
altar and from the candlestick, proceeded in front. He who
gained the lot for the removal of ashes from the inner altar,
entered the Holy Place, and took the flagon, and he bowed
down and went out. He who gained the lot for the removal
of snuff from the candlestick, entered the Holy Place, and
found the two eastern lamps burning; he removed the snuff
from the eastern one and left the western one burning, and
from it he lighted the candlestick in the evening. If he found

it extinguished, he removed the snuff, and lit it from the altar

3. He who gained the lot for the incense, took the pan from
the cup, and gave it to his friend or to his neighbor. When
the incense was dispersed in it, he supplied it to him in handfuls.
And he instructed him, <span class="tei tei-q">“be careful and do not begin
too near yourself, lest you be burned.”</span> He smoothed it and
went out. The offerer could not offer the incense, till the
Captain said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“offer incense.”</span> If the offerer were the
high priest, the captain said, <span class="tei tei-q">“My Lord, High Priest, offer

1. When the High Priest entered to worship, three priests
had hold of him, one on his right hand, one on his left hand,
and one by the jewels on his breast-plate. And so soon as
the Captain of the Temple heard the sound of the footsteps
of the High Priest as he proceeded on his way, he lifted the
veil for him. He entered the holy place, bowed himself, and
went out. And his brethren the priests entered, and bowed
down, and went out.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The priests came and stood on the steps of the porch.
The first came and stood to the south of his brother priests.
And they had five vessels in their hands—the flagon in the
hand of one, and the cup in the hand of one, and the censer
in the hand of one, and the pan in the hand of one, and the
spoon with its cover in the hand of one. They blessed the
people once. In the city they said the service in three
blessings, but in the sanctuary they said it in one blessing.
In the sanctuary they pronounced the Name<a id="noteref_557" name="noteref_557" href="#note_557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">557</span></span></a> as it is

city the priests raised their hands (in blessing) opposite their
shoulders, but in the sanctuary they raised them above their
heads, excepting the High Priest, who could not lift his hands
above the golden plate. R. Judah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“even the High Priest
could lift his hands above the golden plate, as is said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Aaron
lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them.’</span> ”</span><a id="noteref_559" name="noteref_559" href="#note_559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">559</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. When the High Priest desired to offer incense he went
up on the ascent to the altar, and the Sagan (Suffragan) was
on his right. When he reached the half of the ascent, the
Sagan took him by his right hand and helped him up. The
first (priest) reached to him the head and hind foot of the lamb,
and he laid his hand on them, and then pushed them away.
The second priest reached out to the first one the two fore-legs,
and he handed them to the High Priest, and he laid his
hands upon them, and then pushed them away; the second
priest was dismissed, and he departed, and so they reached
out to him all the members of the lamb, and he laid his hands
upon them and pushed them away; but when he desired, he
merely laid his hands on them, and others pushed them away.
He next came to make a circuit of the altar. <span class="tei tei-q">“From what
place did he begin?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“From the southeastern corner, northeastern,
northwestern, southwestern.”</span> They gave to him the
wine for libation. The Sagan stood by the corner of the altar
with the banners in his hand, and two priests stood by the
table of the fat with two silver trumpets in their hands: They
sounded a blast, they blew an alarm, and again they sounded
the trumpets. They came and took their position beside the
son of Arza.<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href="#note_560"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a>
One stood on his right hand and one stood on
his left. The High Priest bowed down to make the libation,
and the Sagan waved the banners, and the son of Arza clanged
the cymbals, and the Levites intoned the chant. When they
came to a full stop, the trumpets sounded, and the people
bowed themselves. At every full stop there was a blast, and
at every blast there was bowing down. This is the order of
the daily offering for the service of the House of our God.
May it be His will to build it speedily in our days. Amen.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The chant which the Levites intoned in the sanctuary on
the first day of the week was, <span class="tei tei-q">“The earth is the Lord's and
the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.”</span><a id="noteref_561" name="noteref_561" href="#note_561"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">561</span></span></a>

to be praised, in the city of our God, in the mountain of his
holiness.”</span><a id="noteref_562" name="noteref_562" href="#note_562"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">562</span></span></a> On the third day they said, <span class="tei tei-q">“God

future, for the day to come, when all will be rest and repose
for life everlasting.

to every Watch in succession with torches flaming before him,
and to every guard who did not stand forth, the Captain said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Peace be to thee.”</span> If it appeared that he slept, he beat him

two Huldah gates in the south which served for going in

his assistants going out to the Mount of Olives.

three in the south, and one in the east. That in the south
was called the gate of Flaming, the second after it, the gate
of Offering; the third after it the Water-gate. That in the
east was called the gate Nicanor. And this gate had two
chambers, one on the right, and one on the left; one the
chamber of Phineas, the vestment keeper, and the other the
chamber of the pancake maker.

6. In the House Moked were four chambers opening as
small apartments into a saloon—two in the Holy place, and
two in the Unconsecrated place; and pointed rails separated
between the Holy and the Unconsecrated. And what was their
use? The southwest chamber was the chamber for offering.
The southeast was the chamber for the showbread. In the
northeast chamber the children of the Asmoneans deposited
the stones of the altar which the Greek Kings had defiled.<a id="noteref_574" name="noteref_574" href="#note_574"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">574</span></span></a> In the northwest chamber they descended to the house of

with stone divans, and the elders of the Courses slept
there with the keys of the court in their hands; and also the
young priests each with his pillow on the ground.

9. And there was a place a cubit square with a tablet of
marble, and to it was fastened a ring, and a chain upon which
the keys were suspended. When the time approached for
locking the gates, the priest lifted up the tablet by the ring,
and took the keys from the chain and locked inside, and the

Levites slept outside. When he had finished locking, he returned
the keys to the chain, and the tablet to its place, laid

he rose and went out in the gallery that ran under the
arch, and candles flamed on either side, until he came to the
house of baptism. Rabbi Eleazar, the son of Jacob, says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“in the gallery that went under the Chel, he passed out through
Tadi.”</span>

3. Inside of the (Mountain of the House) was a reticulated
wall, ten hand-breadths high; and in it were thirteen breaches,
broken down by the Greek kings. The (Jews) restored, and
fenced them, and decreed before them thirteen acts of obeisance.
Inside of it was the Chel, ten cubits broad, and twelve
steps were there. The height of each step was half a cubit,
and the breadth half a cubit. All the steps there were in height
half a cubit, and in breadth half a cubit, except those of the
porch. All the doors there were in height twenty cubits, and
in breadth ten cubits, except that of the porch. All the gateways
there had doors, except that of the porch. All the gates

though some said <span class="tei tei-q">“because its brass glittered like gold.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. And all the walls there were high, except the eastern
wall, that the priest who burned the heifer, might stand on
the top of the Mount of Olives, and look straight into the
door of the Sanctuary when he sprinkled the blood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. The Court of the women was 135 cubits in length, by
135 in breadth. And in its four corners were four chambers,
each forty cubits square, and they had no roofs; and so they
will be in future, as is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Then he brought me forth into
the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of
the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was
a court.”</span><a id="noteref_576" name="noteref_576" href="#note_576"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">576</span></span></a>
In the four corners of the court there were courts
smoking, yet not smoking, since they were roofless. And
what was their use? The southeast one was the chamber of
the Nazarites, for there the Nazarites cooked their peace-offerings,
and polled their hair, and cast it under the pot. The
northeast was the chamber for the wood, and there the priests
with blemishes gathered out the worm-eaten wood. And
every stick in which a worm was found, was unlawful for the
altar. The northwest was the chamber for the lepers. The
southwest? Rabbi Eleazar, the son of Jacob, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I forget
for what it served.”</span> Abashaul said, <span class="tei tei-q">“there they put wine,
and oil.”</span> It was called the chamber of the house of oil. And
it was open at first and surrounded with lattice-work, that the
women might see from above and the men from beneath, lest
they should be mixed. And fifteen steps corresponding to
the fifteen steps in the Psalms, ascended from it to the court
of Israel; upon them the Levites chanted. They were not
angular, but deflected like the half of a round threshing-floor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. And under the court of Israel were chambers open to
the court of the women. There the Levites deposited their
harps, and psalteries, and cymbals, and all instruments of
music. The court of Israel was 135 cubits long, and eleven
broad; and likewise the court of the priests was 135 cubits
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
long, and eleven broad. And pointed rails separated the
court of Israel from the court of the priests. Rabbi Eleazar,
the son of Jacob, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“there was a step a cubit high, and a
dais placed over it. And in it were three steps each half a
cubit in height.”</span> We find that the priests' court was two
and a half cubits higher than the court of Israel. The whole
court was 187 cubits in length, and 135 cubits in breadth, and
the thirteen places for bowing were there. Abajose, the son
of Chanan, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“in front of the thirteen gates.”</span> In the south
near to the west were the upper gate, the gate of flaming, the
gate of the first-born, the water gate. And why is it called
the water gate? Because through it they bring bottles of
water for pouring out during the feast of Tabernacles. Rabbi
Eleazar, the son of Jacob, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“through it the water returned
out, and in future it will issue from under the threshold of the
house.”</span> And there were opposite to them in the north, near
to the west, the gate of Jochania, the gate of the offering, the
gate of the women, the gate of music. And <span class="tei tei-q">“why was it
called the gate of Jochania?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Because through it Jochania
went out in his captivity.”</span> In the east was the gate Nicanor,
and in it were two wickets, one on the right, and one on the
left, and two in the west which were nameless.

1. The altar was thirty-two cubits square. It ascended a
cubit and receded a cubit. This was the foundation. It remains
thirty cubits square. It ascended five cubits, and
receded one cubit. This is the circumference. It remains
twenty-eight cubits square. The place for the horns was a
cubit on each side. It remains twenty-six cubits square.
The place of the path for the feet of the priests was a cubit
on each side. The hearth remains twenty-four cubits square.
Rabbi José said, <span class="tei tei-q">“at first it was only twenty-eight cubits
square.”</span> It receded and ascended until the hearth remained
twenty cubits square; but when the children of the captivity
came up, they added to it four cubits on the north, and four
cubits on the west, like a gamma it is said; and the altar was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
twelve cubits long by twelve broad, being a square. One

its four sides we learn that it measured from the middle twelve
cubits to every side. And a line of red paint girdled it in
the midst to separate the blood sprinkled above from the blood
sprinkled below. And the foundation was a perfect walk
along on the north side; and all along on the west, but it
wanted in the south one cubit, and in the east one cubit.<a id="noteref_578" name="noteref_578" href="#note_578"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. And in the southwestern corner were two holes as two
thin nostrils, that the blood poured upon the western and
southern foundation should run into them; and it commingled
in a canal and flowed out into the Kidron.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Below in the plaster in the same corner there was a place
a cubit square, with a marble tablet, and a ring fastened in it.
Through it they descended to the sewer and cleansed it. And
there was a sloping ascent<a id="noteref_579" name="noteref_579" href="#note_579"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">579</span></span></a>
to the south of the altar, thirty-two
cubits long by sixteen broad. In its western side was a closet,
where they put the birds unmeet for the sin-offering.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Either the stones of the sloping ascent, or the stones
of the altar were from the valley of Bethcerem.<a id="noteref_580" name="noteref_580" href="#note_580"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">580</span></span></a> And they digged deeper than virgin soil, and brought from thence perfect
stones over which iron<a id="noteref_581" name="noteref_581" href="#note_581"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">581</span></span></a> was not waved. For the
iron defiles by touching. And a scratch defiles everything. In
any of them a scratch defiled, but the others were lawful.
And they whitewashed them twice in the year; once at the
passover, and once at the feast of Tabernacles. And the
Sanctuary (was whitewashed) once at the passover. The
Rabbi said, <span class="tei tei-q">“every Friday evening they whitewashed them
with a mop on account of the blood.”</span> They did not plaster
it with an iron trowel, <span class="tei tei-q">“mayhap it will touch and defile.”</span>
Since iron is made to shorten the days of man, and the altar
is made to lengthen the days of man, it is not lawful, that
what shortens should be waved over what lengthens.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. And there were rings to the northern side of the altar,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
six rows of four each: though some say four rows of six each.
Upon them the priests slaughtered the holy beasts. The
slaughter-house was at the north side of the altar. And in
it were eight dwarf pillars with a beam of cedar-wood over
them. And in them were fastened iron hooks—three rows
to each pillar. Upon them they hung up (the bodies), and
skinned them upon marble tables between the pillars.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. The laver was between the porch and the altar, but inclined
more to the south. Between the porch and the altar
were twenty-two cubits, and there were twelve steps. The
height of each step was half a cubit, and its breadth a cubit—a
cubit—a cubit—a landing three cubits—a cubit—a cubit and
a landing three cubits. And the upper one a cubit—a cubit,
and the landing four cubits. Rabbi Jehudah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“the upper
one a cubit—a cubit, and the landing five cubits.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. The doorway of the porch was forty cubits high, and
twenty broad. Over it were five carved oak beams. The
lower one extended beyond the doorway a cubit on either
side. The one over it extended a cubit on either side. It
follows that the uppermost was thirty cubits; and between
each one there was a row of stones.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. And stone buttresses were joined from the wall of the
sanctuary to the wall of the porch, lest it should bulge. And
in the roof of the porch were fastened golden chains, upon
which the young priests climbed up, and saw the crowns. As
it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah,
and to Jedaiah, and to Hen, the son of Zephaniah, for a
memorial in the temple of the Lord.”</span><a id="noteref_582" name="noteref_582" href="#note_582"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">582</span></span></a> And over the doorway
of the sanctuary was a golden vine supported upon the
buttresses. Everyone who vowed a leaf, or a berry, or a
cluster, he brought it and hung it upon it. Said Rabbi
Eleazar, the son of Zadok, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is a fact, and there were numbered
300 priests to keep it bright.”</span>

The outside (doors) opened into the doorway
to cover the thickness of the wall, and the inside doors
opened into the Sanctuary to cover (the space) behind the
doors, because the whole house was overlaid with gold excepting
behind the doors. Rabbi Judah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“they stood in
the middle of the doorway, and like a pivot these folded behind
them two cubits and a half; and those two cubits and
a half, half a cubit and a jamb on this side, and half a cubit

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. And the great gate had two wickets, one in the north,
and one in the south. Through the one in the south no man
ever entered. And with regard to it Ezekiel declared, as is
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord said unto me; this gate shall be shut, it shall
not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the
Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it

The priest took the key, and opened the
wicket, and went into the little chamber, and from the chamber
to the Sanctuary. Rabbi Judah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“he went in the
thickness of the wall, until he found himself standing between
the two gates, and he opened the outside gates from inside,
and the inside from outside.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. And there were thirty-eight little chambers, fifteen in
the north, fifteen in the south, and eight in the west. The
northern and southern ones were (placed) five over five, and
five over them; and in the west three over three, and two
over them. To each were three doors: one to the little
chamber on the right, one to the little chamber on the left,
and one to the little chamber over it. And in the northeastern
corner were five gates: one to the little chamber on

gallery, and one to the wicket, and one to the Sanctuary.

4. The lowest row was five cubits, and the roofing six
cubits, and the middle row six, and the roofing seven, and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. And a gallery ascended from the northeastern corner
to the southwestern corner. Through it they went up to the
roofs of the little chambers. One went up in the gallery with
his face to the west. So he proceeded all along the northern
side, till he reached the west. On reaching the west, he turned
his face southward, going along the west side, till he reached
the south. On reaching the south, with his face to the east,
he went along the south side till he arrived at the door of
the upper story, because the door of the upper story opened
in the south side. And at the door of the upper story were
two cedar beams. By them they went up to the roof of the
upper story, and on its summit rails separated between the
Holy and the Holy of Holies. And in the attic, trap-doors
opened to the Holy of Holies. Through them they let down
the workmen in boxes, lest they should feast their eyes in the
Holy of Holies.

Priest was behind them both, and the roof of the three chambers

the great Sanhedrin of Israel sat, and judged the priesthood,
and the priest in whom defilement was discovered, clothed
in black, and vailed in black, went out and departed; and when
no defilement was found in him, clothed in white, and vailed
in white, he went in and served with his brethren the priests.
And they made a feast-day, because no defilement was found

Rabbi Judah the Holy, said, there were ten heave-offerings,
the heave-offering of the Lord, and the heave-offering
of the tithes, of the dough, and of the first-fruits; and the
heave-offering of the Nazarite, and the heave-offering of
thanksgiving, and the heave-offering of the land, and the
heave-offering of Israelites dwelling in Midian, and the
heave-offering of the shekels, and the heave-offering of the
tabernacle. The heave-offering of the Lord, and the heave-offering
of the tithes, and of the dough, and of the first-fruits,
and the heave-offering of the Nazarite, and the heave-offering
of thanksgiving, were for the priests. The heave-offering of
the land was for the priests, the Levites, and the Nethinim,<a id="noteref_592" name="noteref_592" href="#note_592"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">592</span></span></a>
and the Sanctuary and Jerusalem. The heave-offering of
Midian was for Eleazar the priest, the heave-offering of shekels
was for the sockets of the tabernacle, the heave-offering of
the tabernacle furnished the material of the tabernacle, and
the oil for lighting, and the sweet incense, and the garments
of the priests, and the garments of the High Priest. The
length of the tabernacle was thirty cubits, and its breadth was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ten cubits, and its height was ten cubits. Rabbi José said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“its length was thirty-one cubits.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“How was the tabernacle
set up?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Forty sockets of silver were placed on the north,
and forty sockets of silver on the south, and sixteen on the
west, and four on the east. These are 100 sockets. As is
said,<a id="noteref_593" name="noteref_593" href="#note_593"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">593</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">‘An

boards were placed on the north, and twenty boards on the
south, and eight on the west. On the east there was no board,
but there were four pillars of shittim-wood. Upon them the
vail was hung. As is said,<a id="noteref_594" name="noteref_594" href="#note_594"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">594</span></span></a>

thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim-wood, overlaid

taches.’</span> ”</span> And the sockets were made with holes, and these
were cut out in the boards below, a quarter from one side and
a quarter from the other side, and there was cut out half of it
in the middle, and it made two pins like two supports, and
they entered into two sockets, as is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“two sockets under
one board for its two tenons.”</span><a id="noteref_595" name="noteref_595" href="#note_595"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">595</span></span></a> The pins extended from the

a finger-breadth from one side, and a finger-breadth from the
other side, and they were put into the golden ring, that they
should not separate one from the other, as is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“And they

put in, and every board had in it two rings of gold, one above,

were two upper bars, and two lower (bars) on the south side;
the length of each of them was fifteen cubits. It follows that
two were in length thirty cubits against twenty boards, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the middle (bar) was in length thirty cubits against twenty

east to west, as is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“And the middle bar in the midst of
the boards shall reach from end to end.”</span><a id="noteref_598" name="noteref_598" href="#note_598"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">598</span></span></a>
As the boards were made in the south, so the boards were made in the north,
but in the west they were not so; but the length of the upper
bar and the lower one was six cubits against four boards, and
the middle (bar), twelve cubits against eight boards. And
the boards, and the bars, and the pillars, and the sockets, the
place of the thickness of the boards were overlaid with gold,
as is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“And the boards thou shalt overlay with
gold.”</span><a id="noteref_599" name="noteref_599" href="#note_599"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">599</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“The places for the bars,”</span> there is no meaning in saying,
<span class="tei tei-q">“places for the bars”</span>; and what is the meaning of saying,
<span class="tei tei-q">“places for the bars”</span>? <span class="tei tei-q">“The place where the bar entered
the boards.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“And the bars themselves shall be overlaid with

<span class="tei tei-q">“How was it done?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Two pipes of gold were
introduced—the length of each of them was a cubit and a half;
and they were put into the hole of the board, the place where
the bars were put in.”</span>

ropes and pillars, and they were coupled in the pins of brass;

Rabbi Meier said, <span class="tei tei-q">“even of five years she is allowed, or older.
But they are not to wait (longer) for her, lest she turn black

He said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“thus I heard it, without explanation.”</span> The

to others in counting; but if you say <span class="tei tei-q">‘one of three,’</span> that is, of

over her or put his garment on her, she is disallowed. But
if one bound her with a rope or made a shoe to prevent her
slipping or spread his garment over her because of the flies,

Rabbi Akiba said, <span class="tei tei-q">“even four or five, if they be scattered, may

1. Seven days before the burning of the heifer, the priest
who burned the heifer was removed from his house to the
chamber in front of the Temple Palace toward the northeast;<a id="noteref_726" name="noteref_726" href="#note_726"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">726</span></span></a> and it was called the Stone House. And he was sprinkled
during all the seven days from all the ashes of red heifers
which were there. R. José said, <span class="tei tei-q">“they did not sprinkle him
save on the third and seventh days only.”</span> R. Hananiah, the
deputy high-priest, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“on the priest who burned the heifer
they sprinkled during all the seven days, but on him who took
service on the Day of Atonement they did not sprinkle save
on the third and seventh days only.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. There were courts in Jerusalem built of stone, and beneath
they were hollow,<a id="noteref_727" name="noteref_727" href="#note_727"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">727</span></span></a> through fear of an unseen grave.
And pregnant women were brought, and they were delivered
there. And there they reared their sons, and oxen were
brought with doors on their backs, and the lads were seated
on them with stone cups in their hands. They came to
Siloam, they dismounted, and filled them. They remounted,
and returned on the backs of the oxen. R. José said, <span class="tei tei-q">“from
their seats on the backs of the oxen they let down (the cups)
and filled them (with water).”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The lads came back to the Mountain of the House and
dismounted. The Mountain of the House and its courts were
hollow below, through fear of an unseen grave. And at the
door of the court there were prepared the ashes of the red
heifers; and they brought a ram from the sheep, and they
twisted a rope between his horns, and they twisted a stick and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stuck it into the end of the rope, and it was dipped into the
ashes, and the ram got a blow, and he skipped backward, and
took them, and caused them to appear on the surface of the
water. R. José said, <span class="tei tei-q">“you should not give an opportunity to
the Sadducees for scoffing: but (the lad) took and prepared
the ashes.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. They did not make use of (what pertained) to one red
heifer for a second one, nor did they use another lad for<a id="noteref_728" name="noteref_728" href="#note_728"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">728</span></span></a> his
(prepared) companion. <span class="tei tei-q">“And the lads themselves were in
need of sprinkling,”</span> the words of Rabbi José the Galilean.
R. Akiba said, <span class="tei tei-q">“they had no need of sprinkling.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. If they did not find (ashes) of seven red heifers, six were
sufficient, five, four, three, two, one. <span class="tei tei-q">“And who made them?”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Moses made the first, and Ezra the second, and (there were)
five from Ezra and afterward,”</span> the words of Rabbi Meier.
But the Sages say, <span class="tei tei-q">“seven from Ezra and afterward.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“And
who made them?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Simon the Just, and John the High-priest
made each two. Elihueni, son of Hakuf, and Hanamel
the Egyptian, and Ishmael, son of Piani, made one each.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. And a causeway was made from the Mountain of the
House to the Mount of Olives, with arches over arches. And
there was an arch in front of the last pillar for fear of an unseen
grave. Over it the priest who burned the heifer, and the
heifer with all her attendants, proceeded to the Mount of
Olives.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. If the heifer were unwilling to go, they did not bring
with her a black one, lest it be said, <span class="tei tei-q">“they slaughtered a black
one”</span> nor a red one, lest it be said, <span class="tei tei-q">“they slaughtered two.”</span>
R. José said, this was not the reason, but because it is only
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“That he may bring her forth.”</span><a id="noteref_729" name="noteref_729" href="#note_729"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">729</span></span></a> And the
elders of Israel preceded her on foot to the Mount of Olives. And a
house for washing was there. And the priest who burned the
heifer was rendered unclean because of the Sadducees,<a id="noteref_730" name="noteref_730" href="#note_730"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">730</span></span></a> lest
they should say, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is needful for sunset to pass over him.”</span><a id="noteref_731" name="noteref_731" href="#note_731"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">731</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. The elders put their hands on the priest and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“my
Lord High-priest, wash once.”</span> He descended and washed,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and he came up and wiped himself. And wood was set in
order there, cedar and ash and cypress and fig-wood smoothed.
And it was made like a tower, and windows were opened in it,
and their direction was westward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. The red heifer was bound with a rope of bulrushes and
she was put on the place of preparation, with her head southward
and with her face westward. The priest stood in the
east with his face westward. He slaughtered the heifer with
his right hand, and received (the blood) in his left hand. R.
Judah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“he received it in his right hand and put it into
his left, and sprinkled it with his right hand.”</span> He dipped
his hand, and sprinkled the blood seven times in front of the
House of the Holy of Holies. For every sprinkling of blood
he dipped his hand. When he finished sprinkling the blood
he wiped his hand on the body of the heifer. He went down
and kindled the fire with chips. Rabbi Akiba said, <span class="tei tei-q">“with
palm-branches.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. She burst and moved from her place. He took cedar-wood
and hyssop and scarlet (wool). He said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“is
this cedar-wood, is this cedar-wood?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“is this hyssop, is
this hyssop?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“is this scarlet, is this scarlet?”</span> three times
for each thing. And they said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“yes,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“yes,”</span> three
times for each thing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
11. He wrapped them in the remainder<a id="noteref_732" name="noteref_732" href="#note_732"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">732</span></span></a> of the tongue of
scarlet wool, and cast them into the midst of the burning.
When the fire was burned down, the ashes were beaten with
sticks and sifted with sieves. R. Ishmael said, <span class="tei tei-q">“with stone
hammers, and the work was finished with stone sieves.”</span> A
black piece in which there are ashes must be pulverized, and
that which has no ashes is left. Bones with or without ashes
were pulverized. And they were divided into three parts.
One part was put in the Chel, and one was put on the Mount
of Olives, and one was divided for all the guards<a id="noteref_733" name="noteref_733" href="#note_733"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">733</span></span></a>

blood, everyone busied before her disallowance renders his
garments unclean. After her disallowance he does not render
his garments unclean. It follows that her difficulty is his

for a trespass-offering. They may add wood to her during her
burning. And her business is done in the day and by a priest.

2. Every doubt implies cleanness in the heave-offering and
cleanness in purification. Every reason for suspense in the
heave-offering causes pouring away of the water in purification.

sprinkler of the water of purification, by touching or lifting.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The hyssop, and the water without ashes, and empty vessels

7. All hyssop which has a distinctive name is forbidden,
simple hyssop is allowed; Grecian hyssop, colored hyssop,
Roman hyssop, desert hyssop, are forbidden, and that of the
unclean heave-offering is forbidden, but if it were of the clean
(heave-offering) one should not sprinkle with it, but if one
sprinkled with it, it is allowed. Men must not sprinkle with
the sprouts or the berries of hyssop. When sprinkled with
the sprouts, they are not prevented from entering the temple.
R. Eliezer said, <span class="tei tei-q">“not even with the berries.”</span> These are

9. The order of the hyssop (requires) three roots, and in
them three stalks. R. Judah said, <span class="tei tei-q">“to every root three

bound; if separated and not bound, if bound and not separated,
if neither separated nor bound, it is allowed. R. José

he sprinkled from a private, or from a public window, is free,
since no high-priest is indebted (for an offering) on his entering
the sanctuary. Persons were slipping in water of purification

But the other is called the Bride, for when the Male cometh
that He may consort with Her, then is She the Bride, for She,

And therefore doth Solomon expound those two forms of
the Woman; and concerning the first form indeed he worketh

And concerning this time it is written, Prov. xiii. 23, <span class="tei tei-q">“There

Judgment, so that before it he cannot maintain his place, how
much less before Tzedeq, Justice.

For what is written, Ps. xvii. 15, <span class="tei tei-q">“In Tzedeq, Justice, I will

In the book of the treatise of Rav Hamenuna the Elder he
thus describeth these two nostrils (of Microprosopus), saying
that from the one proceed the smoke and the fire, and from the
other, peace and the beneficent spirits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That is, when (Microprosopus) is considered as having (in
Himself the symbolism of) right side and left side. As it is
written, Hosea xiv. 7, <span class="tei tei-q">“And his smell like Lebanon.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

the Bride, how much more concerning Himself? And
this is a notable saying.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When therefore it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“And Tetragrammaton smelled the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One sense is primary, when the Most Holy Ancient One, the
Concealed with all Concealments, is manifested; for HVA, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hoa</span></span>,
He, is the peace and mitigation of all things.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are two ears for hearing the good and the evil, and
these two can be reduced into one.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As it is written, 2 Kings xix. 18, <span class="tei tei-q">“Incline, O Tetragrammaton,
Thine ear, and hear.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ear from within dependeth upon certain curves which
are therein formed, so that the speech may be made clearer before
its entrance into the brain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the brain examineth it, but not with haste. For every
matter which is accomplished in haste cometh not from perfect
wisdom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From those ears depend all the Lords of Wings who receive
the Voice of the Universe; and all those are called thus, the
Ears of Tetragrammaton.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Concerning whom it is written, Eccles. x. 20, <span class="tei tei-q">“For a bird
of the air shall carry the voice,”</span> etc.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“For a bird of the air shall carry the voice.”</span> This text hath
a difficult (meaning). And now (for so much is expressed)
whence is the voice?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For in the beginning of the verse it is written: <span class="tei tei-q">“Curse not the
King even in thy thought.”</span> Where it is written concerning
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
even the (unexpressed) thought, and concerning the secret
thoughts of thy couch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wherefore? Because <span class="tei tei-q">“a bird of the air shall carry the
voice.”</span> Which (voice) as yet is unexpressed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Assuredly this is the true meaning. Whatsoever a man
thinketh and meditateth in his heart, he maketh not a word
until he bringeth it forth with his lips. (What the text intendeth
is) if any man attendeth not hereunto.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For that voice sent forward (from inconsiderate thought)
cleaveth the air, and it goeth forth and ascendeth, and is carried
around through the universe; and therefore is the voice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the Lords of Wings receive the voice and bear it on unto
the King (Microprosopus), so that it may enter into His ears.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is that which standeth written, Deut. v. 28, <span class="tei tei-q">“And
Tetragrammaton hath heard the voice of your words.”</span> Again,
Num. xi. 1, <span class="tei tei-q">“And Tetragrammaton heard, and His wrath was
kindled.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence every prayer and petition which a man poureth forth
before God the Most Holy One—blessed be He!—requireth
this, that he pronounce the words with his lips.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For if he pronounce them not, his prayer is no prayer, and
his petition is no petition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But as far as the words go forth, they cleave the air asunder,
and ascend, and fly on, and from them is the voice made; and
that which receiveth the one receiveth also the other, and beareth
it into the Holy Place in the head of the King (otherwise, beneath
Kether, the Crown).

From the three cavities (of the brain of Microprosopus) distilleth
a certain distillation, and it is called the Brook. As it is
said in 1 Kings xvii. 3, <span class="tei tei-q">“The brook Kherith,”</span> as it were an excavation
or channel of the ears.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the voice entereth into that curved passage, and remaineth
in that brook of that distillation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And then is it therein detained, and examined, whether it be
good or whether it be evil. This is the same which is said, Job
xxxiv. 3, <span class="tei tei-q">“Because the ear examineth the words.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For what cause doth the ear examine the words? Because
the voice is detained in that brook distilling into the curved
passage of the ears, and doth not swiftly enter into the body,
and thereunto is an examination instituted between the good
and the evil.

<span class="tei tei-q">“As the palate tasteth meat.”</span> Wherefore can the palate taste
meat? Because in the same manner it causeth it to delay, and
(the meat) doth not enter so rapidly into the body. And hence
(the palate) proveth and tasteth it (to discern) whether it be
sweet and pleasant.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And all those six (other conformations), three on this side
and three on that side, go forth, and all depend from those locks
which hang down, and they are extended throughout the whole
body.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But on account of those three (conformations), which are
more connected with the ornament of the beard than all the
others, the Holy Name is written in its purity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When it is written thus, Ps. cxviii. 5: <span class="tei tei-q">“I invoked IH, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Yah</span></span>,
in my trouble: IH, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Yah</span></span>, heard me at large: Tetragrammaton
is with me, therefore I will not fear.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But that which we have already laid down in the Conclave of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Assembly concerning these words, <span class="tei tei-q">“In my trouble I invoked
IH, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Yah</span></span>,”</span> that this is to be referred to that place where the
beard beginneth to be extended, which place is more remote,
and before the ears, is also correct.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And in the book of the dissertation of the school of Rav
Yeyeva the Elder it is thus said and established, that the beginning
of the beard cometh from the supernal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ChSD</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chesed</span></span>, Mercy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Concerning which it is written, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">LK IHVH HGDVLH

Gedulah, (another name for Chesed), Geburah,
and Tiphereth (the names of the fourth, fifth, and sixth Sephiroth,
which Protestants usually add to the end of the Lord's
Prayer, substituting, however, Malkuth for Gedulah), Thine,
O Tetragrammaton, are the Mercy, the Power, and the Glory
(or Beauty).”</span> And all these are so, and thus it (the beard)
commenceth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Therefore the nine (conformations) arise from and depend
from the beard; and thus it commenceth from before the ears.
But (the conformations) remain not in permanence save
through another cause, as we have before laid down.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For whensoever the universe hath need of mercy, the Influence,
Mezla, of the Ancient One is uncovered; and all those
conformations which exist in the most adorned beard of Microprosopus
are found to be entirely mercies, yet so that they can
exercise vengeance against the haters of the Israelites, and
against those who afflict them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the whole ornament of the beard consisteth in those locks
which hang down, because all things depend thencefrom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All those hairs which are in the beard of Microprosopus are
hard and rigid, because they all subject the judgments when
the Most Holy Influence is manifested.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And when there is to be contention, then He appeareth like
unto a brave hero, victorious in war. And then that becometh
bare of hair which is bare of hair, and that becometh bald which
is bald.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moses commemorated these nine conformations a second
time, Num. xiv. 17, when there was need to convert them all
into mercy.
</p>

For although he recite not now the thirteen conformations
(of the beard of Macroprosopus), yet from this idea the thing
depended; for he did not allow himself to enter into those

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But unto the Influence directed he his meditation, and made
mention thereof. As it is written, Num. xiv. 17, <span class="tei tei-q">“And now,

the Holy Influence, called, even the
Concealed with all Concealments. And from the Influence that
Strength and that Light depend.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And since of this (Influence) Moses was speaking, and this
(Influence) he was commemorating, and concerning this
(Influence) he was meditating, he then immediately recited
those nine conformations which belong unto Microprosopus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So that they all might exist in light, and that judgment might
not be found therein. And therefore this whole judgment
(otherwise, this whole beard) dependeth from the Influence.

spake to the Israelites during the Tabernacle by Urim and Thummim, and
under the first Temple by the Prophets, and under the second by Bath Kol. The
Bath Kol, which signifies <span class="tei tei-q">“daughter voice”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“daughter of a voice,”</span> was
a kind of divine intimation, which was as inferior to the oracular voice proceeding
from the Mercy Seat as a daughter is supposed to be inferior to her
mother. It was said to be preceded by a clap of thunder. This, however, was
not always the case. The Talmud relates that <span class="tei tei-q">“Rabbis Jochanan and Simeon
ben Lachish wished to see the face of Rabbi Samuel, a Babylon Rabbi.
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Let us follow,’</span> said they, <span class="tei tei-q">‘the hearing of Bath Kol.’</span> They journeyed near a
school, and as they were passing it they heard a boy reading from the book of
Samuel the words, <span class="tei tei-q">‘And Samuel died.’</span> Observing this, they concluded that
their friend was dead. And it so happened that news was soon brought to
them that Rabbi Samuel of Babylon had died.”</span> The Bath Kol seems to have
been a sort of divination practised with the words of Scripture, like the Sortes
Virgilianæ among the heathen.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_6" name="note_6" href="#noteref_6">6.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">The Rabbis

that in the Shemah there was a confession of the doctrine of the Trinity in
unity—three Persons in One God. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hear, O Israel: Jehovah our God is
one Jehovah. By the first name in this sentence, Jehovah, is signified God the
Father, the Head of all things. By the next words, our God, is signified God
the Son, the fountain of all knowledge; and by the second Jehovah, is signified
God the Holy Ghost, proceeding of them both; to all which is added the word
One, to signify that these three are Indivisible. But this mystery shall not be
revealed until the coming of Messiah.”</span> The Zohar gives also an imperfect illustration
of this great Truth, by saying that the Trinity in unity is like <span class="tei tei-q">“the human voice,

Deut. viii. 8. The Jews make a distinction between Biccurim,
the fruits of the soil in their natural state, and Therumoth, the fruits in a
prepared state, such as oil, flour, and wine. The first fruits were always
brought to Jerusalem with great pomp and display. The Talmud says that all
the cities which were of the same course of priests gathered together into one of
the cities which was a priestly station, and they lodged in the streets. In the
morning he who was chief among them said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Arise, let us go up to Zion to
the House of the Lord our God.”</span> An ox went before them with gilded horns,
and an olive crown was on his head. This ox was intended for a peace offering
to be eaten by the priests in the court of the sanctuary. The pipe played
before the procession until it approached Jerusalem. When they drew
near to the holy city, the first fruits were <span class="tei tei-q">“crowned”</span> and exposed to view
with great ostentation. Then the chief men and the high officers and the treasurers
of the temple came out to meet them and receive them with honor.
And all the workmen in Jerusalem rose up in their shops, and thus they saluted
them: <span class="tei tei-q">“O our brethren, inhabitants of such a city, ye are welcome.”</span> The pipe
played before them till they came to the Temple Mount. Everyone, even King
Agrippa himself, took his basket upon his shoulder, and went forward till he
came to the court. Then the Levites sang, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will exalt thee, O Lord, because
thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.”</span>
(Ps. xxx. 1). While the basket is still on his shoulder, he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I profess
this day to the Lord my God.”</span> And when he repeats the passage, <span class="tei tei-q">“A Syrian
ready to perish was my father”</span> (Deut. xxvi. 3-5), he casts the basket down from
his shoulder, and keeps silent while the priest waves it hither and thither at the
southwest corner of the altar. The whole passage of Scripture being then
recited as far as the tenth verse, he places the basket before the altar—he
worships—and goes out. The baskets of the rich were of gold or silver. The
baskets of the poor were of peeled willow. These latter, together with their
contents, were presented to the priests in service. The more valuable baskets
were returned to their owners. They used to hang turtle doves and young
pigeons round their baskets, which were adorned with flowers. These were sacrificed
for burnt offerings. The parties who brought the first fruits were
obliged to lodge in Jerusalem all the night after they brought them, and the
next morning they were allowed to return home. The first fruits were forbidden
to be offered before the feast of Pentecost, and after the feast of Dedication.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_31" name="note_31" href="#noteref_31">31.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Ps. lxviii. 26.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_32" name="note_32" href="#noteref_32">32.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Lest it be a blessing used on

Chron. xxiv. 14). Each course had a ring to which the heads of the victims
were tied, and also a closet for stores. These were taken from the course Bilgah
as a mark of disgrace. During the persecution of Antiochus, Miriam, a
daughter of Bilgah, married a Syro-Grecian husband. When the Greeks
took the Temple, she struck the altar with her shoe, exclaiming, <span class="tei tei-q">“O wolf,
wolf, how long art thou to consume the wealth of Israel, and canst not preserve
them in their hour of need!”</span> It was supposed that she must have learned
something evil in her father's house, and the whole course was therefore degraded.
The Rabbis say that the courses of the priests were first ordained
by Moses, and that he established eight of them. Four courses he assigned to
the line of Eleazar, and four he assigned to the line of Ithamar. Samuel is said
to have added eight courses more, and the remaining eight were added by
David. The Scriptures, however, assert that David arranged the whole twenty-four
courses. This arrangement continued till the captivity. After the captivity
only four courses returned—namely Jedaiah, Harim, Pashur, and
Immer. The Babylon Talmud mentions Jojarib instead of Harim. To restore
again the number of courses, twenty-four lots were cast into a box, and each
head of the four courses, which returned, drew six lots—one for himself,
and five for the courses which they wished to revive. The restored order
of courses continued as of old, except in the case of Jojarib, who yielded the
first rank to Jedaiah, as Jedaiah was of the family of the High-priest Joshua, the
son of Jozedek. They soon increased in numbers, and we read that each
course kept a station of 2,400 priests at Jerusalem, and half a station at Jericho.
The lesser number was stationed at Jericho to give honor to Jerusalem.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_279" name="note_279" href="#noteref_279">279.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Nisan answered to

twelve lunar months. It is adapted to the solar year by the use of an intercalary
month called Veaddar—the additional Addar. Every nineteen years
there are seven occasions on which this embolismic month must be introduced
to prevent the various feasts revolving over the four seasons of the year, like
the Moslem fast of Ramadhan. Formerly the Sanhedrin arranged this intercalary
month to suit the harvest, so that if it were late, the wave sheaf and
other observances should still be kept according to their proper dates. When,
however, the Sanhedrin was suppressed by the Emperor Constantine, Hillel II
of Tiberias ruled that an intercalary month of twenty-nine days should be
added in the 3d, 6th, 8th, 11th, 13th, 17th, and 19th years of the Metonic Cycle.
This decision has since remained the Jewish standard for reckoning time.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_369" name="note_369" href="#noteref_369">369.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Deut. xxi. 4.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_370" name="note_370" href="#noteref_370">370.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Deut.

I must first observe that Knorr de Rosenroth in his Latin version has
supposed that in the word <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">MChMDIM</span></span>,”</span>
Machemadim, fire and water (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ASh</span></span> and MIM)
are hidden as in a sort of anagram. Now while it is true that
<span class="tei tei-q">“MIM”</span> can be thus extracted, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ASh</span></span>”</span>
cannot, for the remaining letters, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ChMD</span></span>,
will by no exegetical rule I know of form a word signifying fire.
The following I take to be the real meaning of the passage. Chokmah is
the fire, I, and Binah is the water, H, the Father and Mother Who, conjoined,
produce the Son. Now the fire is symbolized by a triangle with the apex
uppermost, and water by a triangle with the apex reversed; these two together
united form the sign of the Macrocosm, the external symbol of Vau, V, Microprosopus.
And He inherits the double qualities of the Father and the Mother,
shown by the word <span class="tei tei-q">“delights”</span> (<span class="tei tei-q">“Machemadim”</span>) being written in the
plural.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_874" name="note_874" href="#noteref_874">874.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The letters of the Hebrew alphabet

            support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number
            of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in
            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
            visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class="tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
            have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and
            addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
            and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file
            is renamed. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Versions</span></em> based on separate sources are treated
            as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
